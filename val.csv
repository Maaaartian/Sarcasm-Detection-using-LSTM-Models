0,"Great recap, I finished watching every single season for the first time in August and now I'm starting my first rewatch of a few seasons - Cagayan ( it was my first season ), currently I'm on Borneo and hopefully I'll get around to rewatch all the seasons.",lost_f1_survivor_got,"Bing-watched Survivor:Fiji (Opinions - Spoiler-ish) Yesterday I started to watch Survivor Fiji (It was my first time actually, I knew the major events like Edgardo blindside, the winner and boot order,though) I almost finished it but I fell asleep during the finale so I finished it today. I want to post my opinions about the season. First of all, I think Fiji is really high-spirited season. During the run, I had smile on my face the whole time. I think It is because of the people that was on the season. The opening: I LOVE the beginning. 19 people lived on same island for 3 days, I have never seen something like that before on Survivor? It was really amazing and I loved how clueless they were. Its a shame they have never done something like that after but at the same time It gives to Fiji a very unique tone. The Have/Have-not twist: You know from what I heard, I really thought It was gonna be much more miserable but I didn't think It was as bad as people say. Yeah it must be really hard to be Ravu, but at least they (production) tried to balance it out with the challenges. The challenges until the merge was not really physical It was more mental and strategy oriented. Some will say but food deprivation also has an effect on mentality and I agree but I think It was more about Ravu's poor strategy on challenges. They came close a couple of times and they blew it. I don't think they should repeat the twist, what I am trying to say is I expected more horrible thing form what I heard beforehand, you know. (It was only very unfair to Sylvia) The twist that screwed Michelle: Again, I am not mad at the twist. It was def not against one person, Michelle just got a really bad luck. This is the nature of the game nowadays, so watching it with modern survivor day mentality, It did not bother me at all. Poor Michelle tho. I would not want to be in her shoes. They should have sent these five to exile and let them strategize for a couple hours imo. Side note, I could not stop about thinking the whole gang-bang thing whenever I saw Michelle lol. What do you think happened? Do you think It is real? If so damn Michelle, at least have a decency to bang Boo, who I think was the cutest male in this season. The fall of Horseman: It is interesting how people pinpoint it on Edgardo blindside. They did a lot of mistakes pre-merge. First they should have got rid of Cassandra instead of Lilliana. Lil would be a loyal solider. What the hell were they thinking? Second, after the tribe swap they should have got rid of Dreamz instead of Lisi. I know Lisi was a flip-flop but she really liked/cared for Ed and Alex and would not quit and screw them in the future. Most importantly, Lisi had a great shot to pull Stacy back with them. Plus she would be a perfect goat. They literally set themselves up for a failure. However, AGAIN I dont think they were as bad people as people say. I mean the only thing that was very mean that they did was Alex's FTC speech. It was very rude to Cassandra and what he asked to her was so pointless lol. Cassandra did not even vote out Stacy. (P.S. I love how Stacy turned from a hating mean person, to a UTR hero and best buddies with Cassandra. I really like her LOL) Idols: It was amazing how It took them 6-8 clues to find the idol and all clues were basically same LOL. I thought last clue would be like ''Damn you suck here is the idol'' . I thought It was better than modern area because It took work and determination. They pinpoint where the idol is nowadays and Its kinda boring. Yau-Man and Earl friendship is TOTALLY friendship goals. I adored them so much. Earl is really as great person/player as some people say and he is very underrated winner. I want him to back but only if he is the same person he was on Fiji. (charismatic, very funny but strategic) If not please do not ruin your legacy Earl. Fiji might be really boring to watch week to week when it aired, but It is one of the greatest season to bing-watch. I highly recommend it, esp If you are having a boring weekend like myself. FINAL WORDS. Fiji is a very very unique season. I know It is not a top-tier season but It is not as bad as some think.In my opinion, Mid-school survivor seasons are the best.."

0,I see you are from the Haidtian School of Esoteric Memetics.,kanagawa,"######First Lesson of Memes Every meme must reference, serious or silly, at least two of the following: 1. Care: cherishing and protecting others; opposite of harm. 1. Fairness or proportionality: rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of cheating. 1. Liberty: the loathing of tyranny; opposite of oppression. 1. Loyalty or ingroup: standing with your group, family, nation; opposite of betrayal. 1. Authority or respect: obeying tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of subversion. 1. Sanctity or purity: abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of degradation. If you do not, then the viewer will not feel emotionally connected enough to spread, upvote, or laugh about it. There is a theory that politically liberals only understand the first two. This means they respond emotionally to any two of the five, but can only create using the first two. If a liberal makes a meme with the first two, it will spread. However if it violates any of others every non-liberal will hate the meme and it will not spread. If a non-liberal makes a meme, it will spread. However liberals may feel odd about it as they don't have any principles to logically understand why they respond to it, they will however spread the meme. #USE THIS KNOWLEDGE RESPONSIBLY"

Also, I never stack weights, it just makes it easier for them to fall off the car. So the fact that this one wheel/tire combo means either the tire or wheel is defective someway or simply paired in the worst possible way.

Like comically bad; far worse than 5 (the AI of which was itself worse than 4) - we're talking bad at a level where it *may* disgust you from playing. Doubt it'll get patched seriously; but hopefully mods will help (there's already a few, although they don't do much thus far). * Pretty bad UI. Most notably, this includes the absence of the ""Alert"" button for units; either they sleep or they don't - no waking up when an ennemy is seen. That should be easy to patch though. * Pretty large ""logic"" bugs there and there (diplomacy feels bugged regularly; also, you can sell some units for far more than what they cost in the ""Buy"" screen, etc.). Easy to patch too. * A few balance issues. Should take a bit longer to patch I guess. All in all, it'll be a great game once those issues are fixed; and there is already far, far more features than in 5 when it launched. The game is also pretty stable and ""feels"" complete. Until those are fixed though, Civ 5 with BNW + an AI mod (or even better, Vox Populi) is still way more fun; although the novelty of a new Civ version is enough (to me at least) to keep me playing to the new one for now."

The first time around I lost 60lbs in 4 months which was incredible, but when I felt like I plateaued, I just lost all drive to keep going at it. Little bits here and there and I ended up dropping Keto altogether. So... I need some help to keep motivated guys. I'm going to be driving forward with this. And after lurking around here for a while, I finally have a smidge of motivation to go full force at this again. I'm currently 6'2"" and roughly 330lbs. My GW is &lt;=210. Time to go at this again, because I'm so sick of who I've been. Its time for a change and I guess this is Day 1... The second time around..."

My question is, can I do this same method at Apple with an iPhone 5C? Or is the model too old?

0,NA doesnt have the population for a good soloq environment.,BombingPanda,"Imo Its too late for NA to become a top region. Regions like Korea started becoming really really good in Season 3. Why? Because they created the kind of solo queue environment that produces hidden talent that they can pick up and mold into amazing players. Think about it like this. Say we take two hypothetically equally skilled players. And lets just hypothetically say both are really really good. Now lets say one is from Korea and one is from NA. In Korea if you're good and consistently shit on pros in solo queue you pretty much WILL get picked up by a pro team or at least looked at. In NA however instead of finding and developing homegrown talent like Korea has done since Season 3, NA has A. Kept washed up pros around for waaaaay too long that needed to be booted ages ago Seasons 3-5 NA was notorious for this. B. Rather than cultivate new up and coming players and try to improve them, they've instead turned to importing. So if hypothetically you're really good as an NA player its very likely you won't even get looked at by a pro team over an import or some old washed up pro with a big brand name, so why bother? And because no one bothers NA solo queue is constantly a joke and everyone trolls, which means players that had the potential to maybe be great with some molding give up and join the troll fiesta and the region becomes a joke year after year. If NA wanted to be a serious Worlds contender it needed to happen years ago, NA needed to immediately boot all its old washed up pros back in Season 3 and not treat LCS like a good ol boys club, then start picking up NA talent out of solo queue and developing it instead of relying so heavily on imports. Then you'd have a self perpetuating flow of quality talent rising through solo queue. But NA orgs and players didn't do that, and so now they don't have that."

0,"Never heard of you, are u from NA?",throwerino,"Guide for Aggressive AWPing As many of you may know I am a former Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike Source professional. I've been playing Counter-Strike for about 12 years and over the years I've learned all kinds of tips and tricks for the game and I'm going to share some of them with you now. 1) Aim!!! I can't stress this enough. If someone comes running around a corner, aim at the fucker before you scope in. It'll greatly increase your chances of hitting them. 2) Jump peek. I know it sounds silly but it's what I was known for back in the CSS days. jump around corners and prescope at where you think the enemy will be, with the new jumping mechanics this is even more effective than before because your character model moves a lot more! 3) Use your pistol! AWPs take way too long to ""reload"" in this version of counterstrike so you have to always be ready to whip out your pistol and spray somebody down. ALWAYS use your pistol for close range, you can move and shoot which you can't do with the AWP. 4) Stop taking out your fucking knife. You constantly see on streams players switching to their knives between every shot. STOP DOING THIS. It doesn't help at all and takes longer to re-scope in. In fact unbind your knife key. Knives are useless in this game unless you sneak up on somebody and can backstab them. 5) Finally, I'll talk about the scout. The scout is an amazing gun when you can't afford an AWP. You move way quicker which makes it much harder for enemies to hit you AND YOU CAN JUMP. So instead of waiting until landing to take your shot with a jump peek you can jump around a corner and hit an enemy while STILL IN THE AIR. That's all I have for my aggressive AWPing guide. Stay tuned for future guides and good luck! -NostraDumAzz"

0,Ouma is a *lucky* bastard.,TheSpecialistMan,"(NDRV3) Theory on the SHSL Lucky Student Now in the previous main 2 games we've had a SHSL Lucky Student but strangely we don't have one for this new game. Now one would think that this could be Rantarou's talent being SHSL ??? and all but I don't think so. I think he'll have a completely unexpected talent that will be some big game changer. Now who could be the lucky student? I'm going with Kokichi Ouma. I don't believe he's actually the SHSL Dictator like he claims and it seems even his bio seems to disagree with him as well. ""A boy with a talent that may or may not be true, claiming that he is the Supreme Leader of a secret, evil organization with over 10,000 members."" ""May or may not"" be true already casts doubt on the talent he claims but just because he's not the SHSL Dictator doesn't mean he has no SHSL talent. He had to have been scouted like the others and also has been captured by Monokuma to participate in a killing game with the others SHSL students. So what could his real talent have been is what I was thinking about until I looked into his name. Sometimes names give away more about the characters. Kokichi has the kanji for ""small luck/fortune"" while Ouma is ""king horse"". King horse could just be for the taken he claims he has of being this dictator while small luck could literally be a reference to his backstory of not being so rich or fortunate at home but at the same time having this good amount of luck that does good things for him when it matters yet he thinks of luck as small and insignificant. He calls himself a evil liar who tells nothing but lies whether kind or bad but the one lie he tells is the one lie he wished was truth which is being the SHSL Dictator. Being a person in position of power and dominance through good or evil methods. He acts this way since it may have been how he was treated at home or in his life but the one thing that kept him going yet the thing he hated most was his SHSL Good Luck. In order to escape the truth about himself he went into the world of lies which is his SHSL Dictator persona. In a sense it would make him similar to Celeste. Both coming off as manipulative liars or claiming they are, coming off as innocent with those fake smiles and hiding things about themselves. Celeste was lying about her name so maybe Kokichi is lying about his talent since like Celeste, it's what he hates and is embarrassed about. To him, being lucky isn't a talent and wants to be better than everyone else unlike Naegi and Komaeda who are content with their luck and roles. Tell me what you guys think. Fun fact: His name Kokichi is written similar to shoukichi which is one of the fortunes you could pull on New Year's Day which means you'll have some good luck within the year. Japanese tradition."

0,?,lBurnsyl,"**8 years from now**: A 26 year old Auston Matthews is the uncontested star of the Leafs. He's already won an Art Ross trophy, albeit in a lockout shortened season. The Leafs reached the conference finals that year. The team has been a steady playoff contender and are expected to be contenders again this season. They start off the season winning their 10 first games. The media hype is crazy, social media is going ballistic and the Leafs are planning the parade already. A month into the season, disaster strikes! They suffer a string of injuries to key players. The team takes a nosedive in the standings. The media frenzy is even crazier than before. The season continues and the Leafs mount an end of season comeback but they lose their final game of the season against the Canadiens, in Toronto, thereby finishing 9th in the division, out of the playoffs. The fans are angry. They are upset. But they're used to it. Despite the shit season, they know they will have a strong season following because they have good players and injuries ruined their current season. A few days before the trade deadline, Toronto trades Matthews to Arizona for 29 year old Max Domi. The fans are livid. A couple of weeks later, they sign UFA Steven Stamkos."

0,Who cares about reviews?,LeftHandedB,"From a more objective point of view Finding Nemo has a higher RT, IMDB, and Metacritic score than Monsters Inc (although Monsters Inc has a higher audience RT score). Subjectively I will make the argument for Finding Nemo (although this is just my argument obviously). The most obvious thing is the animation in Finding Nemo is way ahead of Monsters Inc. I think Finding Nemo also had better characters than Monsters Inc. While the dynamic between Mike and Sully (and to a lesser degree Sully and boo) is great, a lot of the other characters fall flat. Meanwhile Nemo has some of the most interesting and fun supporting characters of any movie period. It seems like all of Nemo the main characters are interacting with one interesting, cool, and funny character after another. In terms of pure story I think there is actually a good argument for Monster's Inc. Monsters Inc story is fairly sophisticated, with some deep underlying themes. Finding Nemo has some good themes about overprotection and family, but beyond that is kinda a light film. However, I don't think this small advantage is enough to offset the other significant disadvantage Monsters Inc has in regards to animation and characters."

As the title states, I'm looking for some guidance from my fellow redditors for what they see as the things that make their gaming groups work the best? I am jealous of other areas I've visited and seen an active gaming community/groups and would like to bring the same to our area. A little backstory: I'm relatively new to gaming (4 years now) and have started getting pretty active in a local Meetup group. The group has a lot of potential but only meets 2-3 times per month. The area the group meets is pretty limited in terms of FLGS support although a board game cafe just opened. As a result, the libraries we use for meet ups are useful, but not ideal, and the same room cannot always be guaranteed for gaming. This leads to larger turnouts sometimes feeling cramped, which is most likely a turn off for casuals. It also means larger games like X-Wing or 40K are difficult to arrange if people would like to try that. To my knowledge, the group doesn't do any promoting outside of the Meetup. The organizers of the group would like to get a small group together to start game planning for 2017 and I'm excited about the possibilities. TL:DR - if you love your game group or game meet ups in your area, why?"

We're on the lower end of ""middle of the pack"", which, hey- SOMEONE has to be. Not everyone can be the best DPS spec, and that's okay. The problem is until you start getting in the 830 range (and even then, only if you're actually getting Haste) you're often getting outdone by tanks against bosses. You have to spec into AoE (and even then you're not great at it) at the expense of single target, or the other way around. The Cleave is pretty good, but even when your numbers are good, complaints still exist: Until you're at like 30% haste, the spec FEELS awful because of how long the cast time on Chaos Bolt is, because we're so reliant on Immolate ticks and Conflag charges to build Shards. I often find myself just spamming Incinerate for 10 seconds straight because I'm at 1 shard with Conflag on cooldown and Immolate already refreshed. Not to mention that you have to take a hit in DPS to get an interrupt, or take a hit in your passive damage mitigation to talent into a 30 second CD, melee-range interrupt. Our damage isn't very good, the rotation is clunky and RNG-enslaved, and we have like ZERO utility. That doesn't get better if you make the numbers on the spells bigger."

The issue would not be commitment, because I understand a certification is worthless without actual experience and application, but I am asking how the certification itself appears to medical schools.

In theory, both teams should be equally bad always, but when I win 75-80% of my games on the week days and then immediately turn around and lose 80-95% on the weekend, something is clearly wrong. It has gotten to the point where I don't even want to play on the weekend. HL, Unranked, QM, it doesn't matter, it's all the same. Loss after loss with clueless players.

On that page it also gives a brief overview of the ages of Golarion, including one where Dragons (and other monsters) reigned supreme. Cue idea where a Dragon gets a glimpse of the future (present day) where they don't reign supreme, and start plotting to time travel to reclaim their empire. My idea for the party would either be just gaining some metallic dragon allies, using an orb of dragonkind to make an army, or just going full ham and making the whole party Dragons. I'd be wanting to have fights filled with dragons, and with normal PCs that'd be hard unless I went mythic. How do you think it'd go if I went about letting all players be dragons as they fought dragons? Again, I came up with this idea in about 20 minutes, so I know it's not too good. I'm just curious."

I started to learn programming a couple month ago and i wanted to know what it's needed in this field to get a first job. I was thinking to get into we development. Can someone with a job in this area tell me what he could program when he got his first job?.

0,Thanks for bringing that to my attention,pier4r,"From what you've written, it seems as though you are looking for the kind of guides that exist for bullet journals -- but those guides exist because bullet journaling is a ""create your own"" system. For planners that have a pre-printed structure, including dates and times, I think the general assumption is that there is no need for a guide, as the use of the planner is inherent in its structure. It is clear (to me, at least) what is intended to be written in each section. For me, I use the monthly layout to make note of big events, or multi-day events, as well as recurring events or appointments. I use the weekly or daily layout for appointments or tasks, and for keeping track of what I worked on that day or week. I hope this makes sense to you. One final thought -- there are some people who have asked how best to use Hobonichi planners, as the Hobonichis come with a LOT of different layouts in a single planner, and some people find that overwhelming, so you may have some luck there."

0,Top quality shit posting.,DehGhostDoctor,"Earthshaker is too weak and should be reworked I think everyone has noticed by now that Earthshaker in his current form is severely underpowered. Icefrog insists on ignoring him patch after patch and the result is this shitshow of a hero. So I thought about a rework of some of his abilities to get him back on meta. 1. Fissure: Low damage skill, all utility. Should be changed to deal a 200% crit of Earthshaker's damage at all levels. To not make this skill too op, make the stun scale per level and remove the fissure produced on the ground. 2. Enchant totem. Great skill, but lacks mobility. His Aghanim's upgrade should be incorporated into the skill itself, and allow him to jump on trees. When targeting the ground, slows the targets hit by up to 50% for 4 seconds, compensating for the lower utility and disable from Fissure. 3. Aftershock: outdated skill, too old to have a place in Dota 2. Change it so after a select number of hits it grants Earthshaker bonus damage and 50% lifesteal for a few attacks. Synergizes with the reworked fissure, granting bonus damage to the crit as well. 4. Echo Slam: I feel this ult is unreliable to pull off. A good buff would be to create an AoE about the size of Gyro's ult and create copies of Earthshaker that hit every enemy inside once every two seconds, and granting him and all his clones bonus damage for the duration. Of course, I would leave it to Icefrog to balance all the values out in a way that isn't too op. What do you guys think?"

Sweden also has a 0% estate tax. Yes 0%. That draws in wealth because wealthy people want to maximize the wealth they leave their heirs.

0,4th edition doesn't exist and you can't convince me otherwise,Semper_nemo13,"**TL;DR 7th-8th level spellcasting is super badass.** In all editions of D&amp;D (although the effect is rather muted in 4th and at least a little rounded off in 5th) including Pathfinder, spells are sort of the maximum measure of available agency in the game. They're the upper limit of what a character can be allowed to do. ""Agency"" is the ability to influence things - kill enemies, bypass obstacles, solve mysteries, compete in intrigues, make high-consequence decisions that forever alter the entire setting's metaphysics, et cetera. Spells give you more of this than anything else, and each spell level spikes up the versatility and power of your agency in a way nothing else does. Having lots of slots available means you can make more decisions, but higher-level slots increase the range of things you can make decisions ABOUT, which usually is the stronger or more ""badass"" choice. 7th-8th level spellcasting is where spellcasters start to enter the realm of ""fiat,"" or the ability to just sort of decide what they want to be happening or not happening without worrying about what might hinder or prevent them, since very little can, and almost all of it involves opposing NPCs also using 7th-8th level spellcasting. It's ""gamebreaking"" in the sense that it transitions you closer to being a mini-DM than the game is equipped to handle mechanically, meaning you start to leave those mechanics behind; storylines become something for discussion and negotiation just as much as they are things to be experienced. Some groups already play that way, though, and a DM who doesn't mind changing up the game style means your game isn't broken, it's just a different game. Your biggest issue is how the other players will feel if they don't have access to the same sort of cosmic power. However, it's also worth noting that most games that don't start at like level 10+ never make it to level 13."

0,How'd you go down to street level in google earth?,TomCei,"Just got Vive yesterday. After a shipping delay from Amazon my cyber Monday Vive with the new cable and straps arrived yesterday. I didn't have much time to set up or test it out due to work and school but did the tutorial and some Lab games with waist level lighthouses. But today me and my cousin rigged up the lighthouses on either end of my room and were able to come up with just a bit over the minimum usable area for roomscale. After some r/techsupportmacgyver techniques to get the lighthouses up we tried out Google Earth for about an hour before getting dinner. And it was mind blowing, to be able to basically walk around the streets of New York and actually look up at the scale of the buildings. At this point i began to feel a little queasy and needed to rest so we went to get food and take a break. After dinner we played another hour of Zombie training simulator and I didn't want to put it down, it was only after realizing that i was fairly sweaty and it was getting late that I decided I should get some sleep before work in the morning. This is my second experience with VR with my first being a short unguided test of an Oculus DK1 at CES a few years ago. That time I had only used it for a few minutes but it left me feeling ill for the rest of the day. So after seeing more recent reviews that many of those orignal problems had been worked out and when I saw the Cyber Monday deals and having another $100 in Amazon gift cards I figured that this was the best time to take the plunge and of course I was a little worried because my dad can get bad motion sickness from somethings, but so far I haven't had any problems. I am rambling now but just wanted to tell my road to VR story becuase this may be the best thing I have done this year and I cant wait to get back into the virtual world.

0,Why not activate the time bank only 15 seconds after the turn started OR your last in-game action then?,buralien,"This reminds me of the interaction between [[curse of rafaam]] and [[Nozdormu]]. A lot of players don't know how to skip the few skip able animations, unavoidable animations eat up a large part of each turn. Players lost games simply to how the animations interacted. I know this is an extreme, but it sets a bar that drawing and seeing two card effects revealed can eat up 15 seconds. I'm all for limiting dead time. This just doesn't seem like the way to do it. But here's an example of a turn that happens occasionally when playing druid. I play violet teacher into innervate into wrath. Just from the animation of the violet teacher entering play, the stupidly long animation of choose one and then wrath itself, drawing a card, and two violet teacher activation, I probably used up more than my allotment of time and had to dip into my bank. That's assuming I made no attacks, had no other minion effects activate (knife juggler), and had nothing happen on my opponent's side (cat trap). The animations alone probably ate up my 15 seconds of allotted time, any thinking or misclicks I make are eating into my time bank. Then on the next turn I play staghelm into raven idol. There's no way I'm going to be able to complete this turn without dipping into my bank again. On neither turn am I attempting to stall. One turn is eaten up mostly due to animations. The other is spent thinking and planning. When do I have a chance to 'store up' my time bank after turn one and two? Each turn requires careful planning to play appropriately both to secure my win condition while also managing the board. Compare to face hunter. Play minion, hero power, attack face. Spend the remaining time emoting."

So. I push the spark. I get the points. Occasionally I die. Occasionally I last just long enough to die and then that team I left behind is sitting where the spark will pop once that other team ventilates my Guardian. But when I get 6000 points in a late push because I carried 4 times because everyone else is waiting for a perfect carry, I'll take the win over the ""right"" way to play. My 2 glimmer anyway."

They don't know anything about the OPM universe prior to arriving. Their arrival isn't noticed until they start conducting evil, so if they want prep then they simply need to evade detection from the hero association for however long they need.

0,I think that they should simply completely commit on Chawy and train with him.,Hiryougan,"This is one of those threads again. Chawy wasn't allowed to play a single game the whole summer split. He did however scrim with the roster from time to time and had his time to prove himself in spring. If the team decided that Westdoor was the better fit (which they did), there was a reason. The one game chawy played with AHQ at worlds, he himself looked really good, but the rest of the map looked worse than they usually did. That may or may not have been because Westdoor was not on the map, we don't know, but a fact is that Westdoor often gives up his own lane to help his team with his roaming style, so maybe that was what was missing. I do not give any fault to Chawy in that game, but I think it was a bad decision by AHQ to even use Chawy when he didn't play a competitive game in over a split."

In addition to this in the councils of ricks episode they pull him in for allegedly killing 27(or whatever it is) other ricks. Now since there are infinite universes surely there are an equal amount of ricks that have saved those 27 and stopped rick c-137 (assuming it's him The whole time) from doing bad stuff meaning he's not bad. So why are they punishing him since he's technical completely morally neutral since infinite universe mean all the bad and the good should cancel out. Opinions?"

I remember laying awake in bed at night not wanting to believe what my friends were saying in school that Santa was not real. In my heart at the time, I couldn't believe that a lie that big was globally possible and that there had to be another solution. The only possible conclusion I could conjure that made sense was that Jesus was Santa! I felt so smart for figuring it out on my own! I couldn't wait to talk to my parents! So, the next day after school, I sat my parents down all serious-like and told them that I knew the ""truth"" about Santa and that they could now spill the beans with me because ""I could handle it"". (I didn't want to say outright that I thought it was Jesus because I wanted confirmation. I wanted them to say it).

0,The data is there: 2 and 3 players ranked is dead.,Leolio_,"Where is the data about the impact of duo-queues in HL? From the thread about the matchmaking and wait-time problems now plaguing TL after the change to solo-queue only in HL, there seems to be a consensus that players in 2-man parties did some kind of harm to the old HL? What is the evidence of this? I asked this question there, but I was late and the thread has been buried I am afraid. The reason I ask for this is that I find the assertion hard to believe, since in my experience duo players are matched with duo players, making their impact on the win percentage of other players insignificant. Either the duo you are matched with is better than the other teams, or they are worse. This is no different than any other player on your team, sometimes you luck out, most of the time they are all ok. Now, grouping two people makes matchmaking a little more tricky, but the party rules are already pretty stringent for HL, and could be tightened further. At least there was parity between the teams in old HL . In TL, however, the introduction of 2+3 teams makes matchmaking a complete joke since there is no way to measure a 2+3 team vs a 5-man group in a good way. Regardless, I assume that there is some kind of data out there that shows how duo-queuers are dominating HL and ruining it for solo players, making them unable to rank up, since this is such a firmly held belief. If this is real thing, then the evidence should be plentiful. I can accept that this is a necessary changes if there is good evidence that it will help a lot of people in HL, but since it appears to be ruining party based gameplay in a ranked setting, I would really like to see the evidence myself. Can someone help me?"

Yellow cake, with a mound of incredibly delicious pink frosting on top, covered with a firmer green icing and decorated to look like a frog. They were ambrosia. They were the best dessert *ever*. Getting to eat one was a foretaste of heaven. So, on my first leave from the Navy, when I was visiting my father, I picked one up out of nostalgia. It looked and smelled exactly the same. Giddy with delight, I dug in. *oh my fucking god* A glob of sugared lard had been plopped onto a stale round of cheap shortcake and covered with some horrific chemical tasting glop. The inside of my mouth was coated in grease. The cake part was so dry I almost choked. I put my fork down in horror, realizing that I had just attempted to poison myself. My stomach roiled. The artificially pink frosting looked and tasted like chemical warfare. I set my fork down Gagging a little, I stared sadly at the remains of my childhood delight. My father and stepmother looked at my expression with a mixture of amusement and sympathy. ""Gak."" I managed to gasp, eyes bulging, as I desperately reached for the nearest glass of water.

According to Rose's grimore, the Noble Circle Of Horrorterrors refers to a small circle of gods in the furthest ring. Immediately this should set off klaxons in your head. Noble in SBURB refers to the players of a void session. In other words, the squiddle session was void, and needed to be scratched. The horrorterrors are the grimdark god tiers who escaped Obviously the Z2 sessions succeeded, so where are the squiddles? Shouldn't there be squiddles living on after the end? Well, that assumes the squiddles in the squiddle session WERE in fact squiddles, but they're not. Squiddles and Horrorterrors are just the trickster and grimdark versions of a single race so innocuous you probably forgot they were even there: Cuttlefish! Yes, cuttlefish are everywhere, and as they are directly correlated to the squiddles. Jade's lunchtop has squiddles, Kanaya's has cuttlefish, and surprisingly this isn't all that impossible. Cuttlefish in real life are pretty damn smart, and in a work like homestuck where a horse can operate a teleporter that intelligence is magnified to make them functionally human in intellect. And last, Cuttlefish are everywhere on alternia! They are the descendants of the squiddle gods!"

There were times when I told myself, it's time to change, but I would fall back in my indolence way in about a week or two. I have no concept of cleanliness. I have a had time keeping my apartment clean. I would try but it would revert back to its former condition in a day or two. The lack of my parents' affection drove me to be needy. I am still struggling with relationships. As of now, all of my relationships had ended horribly. I pissed away some very good women."

0,But widowmines,SnowMoonCrocket,"The void ray buff does not make sense, if this patch is designed to make factory based play a viable strategy what factory unit is terran supposed to produce to fight void ray's? Cyclone's are armoured so they take bonus damage from prismatic alignment, the lock-on ability now does 160 damage over 14 seconds so 11.4DPS which is less than the void rays base 27.7DPS vs armoured and much less than the 44.4DPS when prismatic alignment is turned on. Cyclones might be faster and out-range the void ray but on the defense with your back against the wall you need to fight straight up and one void ray will beat two cyclones in a direct engagement. Widow mine's aren't effective because they're out-ranged, they can't work unless the protoss player isn't paying enough attention. Even if you get a shot off you still need a cyclone or a second widow mine hit to finish the job. The best a widow mine can reliably do is zone out the void ray but even at the current speed the void ray is so much more mobile it can still be effective wherever the widow mine isn't. One thor can beat one void ray but they don't scale well, an early game thor might hold off a void ray all-in but late game vs thors a mass void ray force should just roll over the terran. Vikings can't fight head on against them either, you have to kite. Making the void ray faster just makes kiting less effective. Even without the void ray buff I don't see any reason to go mech vs protoss. You need marines to deal with the threat of void rays and if I'm making marines then I need to upgrade them and I can't afford any factory units because I'm too broke from losing all my SCV's to adepts shading between my mineral lines and jumping in and out of warp prisms. tl;dr the void ray hard counters mech, why the fuck would you buff it?"

To be honest, Jiading North &amp; West stations are just to the west of that university town there. Chinese campuses usually have lovely parks and are used to lots of takeaways and just ""stuff"" which foreigners need, so it'll be a well-serviced area and probably pretty nice to look around too. There is a bit of an 'old village' in this area too and some interesting cultural stuff like the Imperial Examination Museum of China + dumplings stuff. Failing that, just find out where Walmart or Carrefour or whatever big local hypermarket is out there, and shoot for a 1km radius around there. I'm not sure from your post if you're already in Shanghai, but if you're looking for houses there is no better way than hitting the pavement and looking around the area.

Atheism isn't an assertion of fact. It's a denial of evidence. Agnosticism is an acknowledgement that there is no proof, but you don't want to fight about it. If someone tells me a mad ocelot god runs the government, the logical response is to say ""I need proof, because that contradicts everything I know about everything"", not ""well you MIGHT have a point, but I doubt it.""

The rep told me a couple things. 1) Best Buy is currently accepting returns on Note 7's and is exchanging them with either an S7 or an S7 Edge. No more Note 7's are being sold/distributed by Best Buy. I'm on the last day of my 14 day return window, so I could return mine today. But she said that they're awaiting final confirmation on whether to allow returns after 14 days on Note 7's. 2) Regardless, they will waive the $35 restocking fee. 3) You get to keep your Gear Fit 2 or 256gb memory card. 4) The replacement S7 or S7 Edge is not a temporary or loaner device &amp; does not come with a new 14 day return window. It is an official exchange &amp; it is final. 5) To do the official recall exchange, you must go through Samsung directly. Although there hasn't been an official timeline on this process, she said she had heard rumors of ~2 weeks between when you send in your Note 7 &amp; when you get a new one. There will not be a loaner device given in the meantime, so if you don't have your old phone, you're without a phone for that time. 6) Even though I bought my phone through Best Buy, some carriers are allowing phones to be exchanged directly through them, but this is on a per-carrier basis &amp; policies may differ (I've yet to talk to Verizon). Hope this helps others avoid being on hold for 30 minutes like me."

We have different rights and responsibilities that complement one another. 3. You can leave Islam in the sense that you can change religions. However, if you do try to publicly go against the state, you can't do that. 4. No. As a matter of fact, it is a very good one. I'm not sure what you want me to say here lol. 5. The punishments are not outdated because the Qur'an is timeless. The problem nowadays is that states and quasi-states like Saudi Arabia and ISIS abuse that for their own material gain. The context of the punishment is very important, and these organizations toss that out the window. 6. You can question the Qur'an's authenticity in the sense that you can ask how it was preserved over its 1400 years that it's been here. But you cannot question the fact that it came from God. Otherwise, you're not a Muslim. As for the Qur'an's guidance, you should not question it until you see it correctly implemented. 7. No, because that can make him an icon, and worshiping a Prophet of God is polytheism. Look at Christianity and what they have done to Jesus (particularly Catholicism). 8. It depends on what you mean by condemn. All terrorism is bad, and Muslims are against it. But why should I be held responsible for someone else's actions? 9. It depends on whether or not that person is married and has gone through puberty. 10. We are required to live under the reasonable laws of society (even non-Muslim ones)."

What about richa's sister he mentioned talking to? So I tried to find if all this is fake or not, so I searched for his facebook and one thing led to the another and I found a bunch of info he should delete. I sent him a reddit PM and an e-mail to an ID which I found. Based on no reply from him, he doesn't check mail or doesn't use that ID. If any of you guys found the info I am talking about, did you notify him? If not, how do we contact him?"

You can fedi dungeon with resets and tomes to 190 (you will vomit from all the golems you kill) or you can actually quest. roughly. Every run can take 10-20 minutes so this is where the bulk of time will be spent on either questing or dungeon reset missions. 190 dungeon 3x on 300% can get you into the 200s easily or you can almeth anyways at a low level, probably 3-4 hours at almeth with 300% tome will get you to 248. an hour or 2 at storage will get you to maven levels, 3 hours at maven will get you to 290 levels which you can go to timery.

And even many people who would be willing to do so will have problems with that because: 1. They lack the background knowledge to do some of the steps, like ""put your IP address here"". Without that background knowledge, that's a nonsensical step. 2. If they make even a tiny error, they can't recover from it, because they can't understand what went wrong. They may not even realize they made an error. When this happens, they conclude the guide ""doesn't work"" and abandon it. Maybe it's because they are afraid to do it, but that doesn't change the fact that _they don't have the chops_. The reason why doesn't really matter, and simply declaring that it's easy doesn't change that. Yes, a person who is sufficiently motivated can learn to do this. Then they would have the chops. But most people don't have the chops, and don't care enough to acquire them (and the predecessor skills), which means that Netflix doesn't care about roll-your-own VPN because it will remain a tiny, _tiny_ minority of users. And it also means that ""just setup your own VPN server"" is pointless advice for 99% of people who have this problem."

We tried telling her about the importance of herd immunity to immunosuppressed kids and she said she didn't care. What I wanted to tell her is to ""research"" what the diseases we vaccinate against look like, just a quick Google search, but my attending said that's basically fear mongering and doesn't help. I said fear is a useful signal and maybe understanding that the risks of NOT getting vaccinated greatly outweigh the risks of getting the vaccine (while i know vaccines in NO way cause autism, for the purposes of the explanation, i would venture to include autism as a risk because as far as worst case scenrarios go, i think permanently disfigured or dead child is way worse than autistic). Have you guys seen this before? What did you do? How do you think it's best handled?"

Headshots are non-revivable and there's a heavier emphasis on howitzers and mustard gas attacks. If they want realistic, let's give them what they want in the most literal sense.

0,Thanks for sharing!,Ryan256,"I shall try :) It was really just a breathing technique. Get into a rhythm with your breathing, ensuring you are using your diaphragm, I imagine the bottom of my lungs pulling down along my spine. Don't force the breathing too much, leave time between inhaling and exhaling so you almost feel the need to breath again, but not in a breath holding kind of way. Once you are in a decent rhythm, begin focusing on letting go of the muscle you are having issues with - while exhaling. It sounds kind of funny to focus on letting go, there's a kind of balance you have to reach between placing too much attention on it and letting go of it. Sometimes I find I'm too focused on a muscle and tension builds, so I alternate between letting go of the muscle on exhale, and letting go of your whole body. Try and imagine your body sinking down on the exhale. I find it also helps imagining the muscle lengthening as you exhale, especially for your neck. Something else you could try that I find helps is feeling a kind of buzz around your solar plexus when breathing in, then moving that to the tight muscles when you exhale. Sometimes my neck and shoulders are too tight and these techniques don't do a whole lot, but I've found if you use these starting with your feet, legs, waist, etc, breathing through all your muscles up until your shoulders and neck, seems to allow them to relax a lot more. You know you're doing it right when it feels like the part of the body you were focusing on kind of goes numb, indicating you've successfully let go of it. Hope that helps! :)"

This last Saturday, the cashier went home early at 4pm, with everyone else. I had to take over front end, the manager was too ""busy"" to run the floor, so he locked himself in the office. I had to close and clean front end and block the entire store afterwards. The store was a mess because no one was on the floor doing maintenance since 4pm. Oh, and I was expected to do all of this by 9:45, after closing at 9. I'm getting a little tired of blocking the entire store myself every weekend.

I need advice on how to ask my landlord for a fenced backyard. Background info: we moved into a 3 bedroom town home which is on a busy street. Our landlord is a first time landlord but he's been really awesome and we haven't had any issues yet. He asked us to sign a two year lease instead of a one year lease and in return he would lower our rent from 1500 to 1475. This was fine for us especially since this neighbourhood usually had town homes for rent at about 1550 and above. The house itself is quant and has a few things that need to be fixed ie)old appliances, very very old carpets etc. But so far we haven't asked for anything because we have two young kids and the older the better frankly. The issue at hand; our oldest son (2.5) has been diagnosed with Autism and he's a runner. He's also fast. The backyard is not fenced at one side which happens to be the side that faces the main road. We would like to ask him to consider putting up some sort of fence so when our son bolts we don't have to chase after him with our youngest (6 months). My problem is I can come off as stern when I talk and I'm looking for a polite, pr sessional yet tentative way to inquire about the chances of getting a fence. Also looking for how to say we'd be willing to renegotiate the lease in his favour in order to make up the money he'd lose in putting up the fence. We are also looking to stay here for the long term so if this fence goes up that makes staying here much more likely. Thanks for your advice everyone! Also we're in Ontario, Canada if that helps TL;DR need to ask landlord for a fence without sounding rude and entitled."

Well, the first try resulted in my credit card being declined and an automated call from my bank telling me about a suspicious transaction. The bank declined the transaction automatically to protect me against fraud. After allowing the transaction, I completed the purchase and waited. A week later and the order is still processing. I call Microsoft's customer service and I'm redirected to a call center in India, where they have absolutely no idea of what's happening with my order. They cannot give me a status and suggest that I wait some more. Three days later, it's been two weeks since I ordered, and the order is still processing. I call them again, and they move my file up to the specialized team in the US. This morning, I find that my order has been canceled and erased from my account. I haven't received a call or an email about it. They just canceled the order and now the deal is over. I'm never buying from Microsoft again and I suggest you avoid the Microsoft store altogether."

But are the British cruisers just **too** vulnerable to it? Beyond gameplay balance and fun. I'm predominantly a CL player, with at least T6 in every tree and most of the Premiums to boot, so I'm used to being squishy, and I'm used to CL play style and dodging battleships - but for the first time I feel like a series of ships are unreasonably easy to blow up: they get blown up absolutely instantly and it stops being fun to play. I get that the gameplay of CL's is to avoid getting too much attention from Battleships, but it's literally impossible to avoid enough attention with a British cruiser as is needed: especially when, as far as I can tell, angling does literally nothing to help other than making a couple of shells miss due to dispersion. I've given them a chance until T6 so far, hoping things improve, but I'm halfway to the Fiji and things just aren't getting better. The Leander (T6) takes more damage from T5 battleships than the Mikhail Kutozov (T8) takes from the Yamato or Montana (T10s). So, are British cruisers just a bit too squishy, meaning you cannot make **any** mistakes? I feel like they're intended to be glass cannons, but they don't have the damage for that either, so you just end up with the glass part. I don't mind ""High risk, high reward"" gameplay, but the British cruiser line just doesn't have the high reward to go with the high risk Discuss?"

He's going to mope around, claim the system is biased, then tweet that Bill Clinton is a rapist. Wednesday will go by, then Thursday, then Friday. He will never actually concede.

0,Well said.,LongTimeDoubter,"I went to church on Sunday and discovered my biases are still alive and well. I went to church yesterday for the first time in a couple of months to support a family member. The theme for the talks in SM was ""tolerance."" [Cue the internal eye roll.] The talks were fairly innocuous if taken at face value, but I knew better! I know the church's history. I know that its preaching of ""tolerance"" rarely advances very far beyond its own doorstep. These speakers were deluded sheep and had no idea what the fuck they were talking about. They had no idea how hypocritical their church really was. The anger phase started creeping back into me and my blood started to boil. The last speaker got up and started echoing the same pablum served up by the other two. Look at this blonde haired, blue eyed, Peter-priesthood clone. What a fucking idiot! Then he shared a story. He talked about his uncle (dad's brother) and what a great guy he was. He talked about how much time his uncle spent with his nieces and nephews and that he was always there to listen to their problems or help out. He talked about when he was a child in a small tight knit mormon farming town, this uncle came out to the family as homosexual. Some family members completely distanced themselves from him, cutting him off from their lives. The speaker's dad, however, told his brother that none of that mattered and didn't change anything in their relationship. Because of that, the speaker and his siblings grew up with this uncle as a big part of their lives, and he realized that his extended family's intolerance had only hurt themselves by icing this wonderful person out of their lives. The speaker didn't add any bullshit ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" qualifiers. He just let the story stand on its own and ended the talk. It completely caught me off guard. I realized that I had judged him (and by extension, the other two speakers) as a faceless TSCC clone, rather than as a human being. I had completely projected my feelings about the LDS Church onto him, even though there was no objective reason to. I caught myself treating him as a label rather than as an individual, and I need to change."

B) The last link I posted (gosugamers) shows the rankings in professional hearthstone. You can clearly see that EU has far higher and even more rankings than NA, therefore proving that EU has a far more competitive scene than NA (which is even confirmed by pros from all over the world in different interviews, lastly seen at blizzcon before the half finale). C) Like I said in my first sentence, waiting for your own legend proof, not something stolen from google images. To show me that its you it need either your name which is reddit related, or if its not, then a picture of your last top 200 legend rank and on another picture the same name with something written in the chatbox to proof it, because until now you are only lying. Ah and if you want to really show me your skills, dont post wild, post standard ladder, which is far more competitive even in NA. And because I know that you are full of shit (because if you wouldnt be, then you would show instant proof of you being legend) I know that you only will troll on and then this will be my final response. PS: Yes this is how it feels when you got rekt and exposed for being a fraud."

Unfortunately I broke my foot and didn't end up starting again.. Now I've moved to a new city and the gym is way out of my budget, so I've decided to start running outside. I'm looking for an app that can map a run for me, given a certain distance. For example, from my front door, in a loop and back to my door that's roughly 5k. I don't know if this exists, but I figured if anyone knew it would be you guys :)"

0,Nobody here is arguing that she's worse than Trump.,Purlpo,"Hello, fellow Bernie supporter here. I would have absolutely loved to have the chance to vote for him in the general. But, as another poster pointed out, the general is for pragmatism. I was not a fan of Clinton, but it is inane to argue that she was a worse candidate than Trump. Yes, she had baggage and policy that I did not particularly agree with or care for, and she also pulled shit in the primary against Bernie that soured my taste toward her. But the fact of the matter is, she was far more prepared and qualified than Trump, and her policy was significantly better as well. She's flawed, absolutely. But to argue that she is in anyway worse than Trump is idiotic. Things would not be perfect under her, just as they weren't perfect under Obama, but I expect our President Elect's tenure to be a four year long dumpster fire (as long as the invertebrate Republicans refuse to impeach him)."

0,"But when dealing with humans and international/domestic events, Democrats need to learn that sometimes things get messy, and just because your house isn't spotless doesn't mean that the entire thing needs to be torn down.",moleratical,"Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line. It's not that surprising from my (admittedly, totally biased) perspective as a democrat. Democrat voters care deeply about fairness, respectability, and truth. More than that, we tend to take the collective opinion that the right is dismissably crazy and that we can tolerate precisely none of that on our side. In a way, I think that's a mature position; we want to put our own house in order first. Meanwhile, the GOP is a mixing pot of ideals and single-issue voters who mostly only agree that they want to Fuck Shit Up in Washington. As they've demonstrated, they are perfectly willing to overlook anything to win as long as their candidate pays lip service to their pet issue and promises to 'drain the swamp'. Then, once they win, they're pretty much happy to ignore the actual goings on in this swamp. Think about it this way: Republicans are more or less silent right now about Trump's nominees. And fair enough, they don't believe in climate change, so the head of the EPA isn't going to raise eyebrows. But Labor Secretary Puzder? He has a clear vested interest in keeping working class wages down and he's not shy about saying so. But the Republicans don't say anything, because they don't care. Can you imagine if Hillary had won and nominated someone even remotely similar? We would be eating her alive right now. And that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats."

And while theres way more space on the desktop I'm not trying to be insanely nit-picky about white space but there's so much of it that my monitor 12 toggles take up two pages. Basically because the font size is stuck at like 32 and the actual toggles are on their own lines instead of to the right.

I usually use the ""*Help!*"" voice command to try to get people to slow down for the buff, but that has yet to work. So, I guess a bonus PSA is, ""Pay attention to voice comms, they might be serious!"" &amp;nbsp; *Note*: Once you've slowed down, if you're a Heavy or another Soldier, it's not necessary to slow down for the rebuff; you're moving slower or at the same speed as your fellow Soldier, so just keep running until you decide to breakoff or run into an enemy."

If the only way for you to counter a summoner spell with with another summoner spell, it's an issue. All these ADC killers have really solid gap closers, and even the ones that don't just flash on you and you either use your flash or die. Lee, Hec, Yas, Zed, Kha, Vi, Camille, etc all can reach you with a normal spell and you HAVE to rub a 300 second cd summ to deal with that? Like no, that's kinda dumb.

Ice Yeti is a cheap sacrifice that slows down the sparky charge allowing troops to kill sparky without a proper surround before sparky can even charge back up Inferno Dragon is a flying unit. A sparky decks biggest weakness is air. This card will melt your sparky and then turn around to melt your Giant Balance update hurt Sparky Lightning deals massive damage to Sparky and resets charge Log if timed correctly can reset Sparky Even previous changes are hurting Sparky The zap buff has increased use of Rocket and Freeze. While it is true that this is what fair gameplay is, Sparky players should have some sort of chance to win rather than having to wait for the opponent to foolishly use that spell Please fix this SuperCell. Sparky is one of those cards that promote that offensive strategy that you wanted sometime back in March and Sparky honestly needs some sort of buff to survive this rocky meta. I'm aware that some cards like Skarmy and Baby Dragon just don't have a place in the meta but the last time a #legendary was underpowered (The Log) you gave it a buff so why can't Sparky get a buff now? Sparky is barely bordering on legendary but after the release of these new cards, Sparky players will have an even tougher time to deal with the pool of cards pitted against them and this might eventually facilitate the death of Sparky altogether."

Last year we had 3, but Valve has cut it down to two Majors + TI every year. The Shanghai Winter Major of the last round was very poorly received, so most expected Valve to keep 1 Major in EU (probably Frankfurt) and one in SEA (i.e. Manila). Now it's pretty debatable where the other Major will take place. Frankfurt seems the most likely, since Frankfurt/Germany has a decent scene and tournaments have done well there in the past. Though Manila was very well received. I've seen a couple of people complaning that NA gets two Valve events now, but to be fair Boston is 3,000 miles from Seattle (farther than two ends of Europe if I'm not mistaken). What I'd like to see is Valve cycle the events every year so a few notable regions get a Major out of a handful. They can try China again, but I don't see it for at least a year or two."

Hey everybody, I just wanted to drop a quick little announcement to let you guys know of two minor changes that we've made to the threads you see every week. This isn't going to be made into a sticky, since the other two posts are much more important than a small change like this, so if you could, please just upvote this for visibility! Shout-Out Saturday has started to fall by the wayside as time has gone on, we've noticed fewer and fewer people coming in and shouting out their fellow NewTubers, so we've decided to cut it for now, and possibly bring it back later down the road. In its place, we're moving Watch Me Wednesday over and renaming it Self-Promote Saturday, because we like alliteration! This will leave Wednesday open for other, most likely less-alliterative community threads, and allows Self-Promote Saturday to stay up at the top of the sub for a bit longer than it otherwise would. If you've got any ideas for a potential Wednesday thread, by the way, we're always happy to hear them! Right now Wednesday is probably going to be saved for more infrequent things like the little competitions we did for Halloween and now the Christmas/Winter Holiday/whatever you prefer I call it, but we're always all-ears for suggestions! TL;DR Watch-Me Wed is gone, Shout-Out Saturday has been replaced by Self-Promote Saturday."

0,"Sure why not, could make ZGS worth something.",jetzido,"Incredibly rare drops. Hello guys! My idea would be to add some incredible rare drops to some monsters. They could be added to different slayer creatures or bosses, and these items could give a little variety to the game. Make very rare drops untradeable, which if you want to get you need to be really lucky. You can get these items from the respective bosses or slayer creatures, with a given drop rate (like 1/1500 at Araxxor - just to show rarity). These items would be some more powerful items, or purely cosmetic items. For example: Toxic fang - You can make a Toxic Scythe from it, which has a Weapon poison+ effect. Imbued eye - You can make Imbued Staff from it, which gives infinite fire runes. Dusty web - Make Dust-Covered Bow, which has a chance to debuff your target's accuracy. These would be untradeable, and the weapons too, but you can anytime convert them into a normal weapon to sell them. (Augmentable and dyeable too if the normal item is augmentable and/or dyeable too). If you don't want to give these special items an effect, then they could just be cosmetic. OR they can be tradeable, like you can get addons from a rare drop from gwd2, or get special looking skilling effects from rare DKS and Chaos Battlefield drops. This could maybe revitalize dead-content slayer and boss creatures, give players more incentive to kill different kind of monsters and give a small chance to everybody to make bank, if they are lucky (if you choose the tradeable rare drop idea). As these would be very uncommon, I except their price to be high. Tl;Dr: Make incredible rare drops from bosses/creatures, which could give little bonus effects, or have cosmetic purposes only. Show your luck - wealth with them. If you're very lucky, you can make bank with these. I'm open to all of the ideas, please comment what you think about these."

0,you two are the real MVPs.,Pola_Xray,"Yes with emphasis on the vocal part and about the discovery part. The last real relationship I had (who was also the second person I ever had sex with) was with a girl who never talked about sex and while she always finished, she never wanted to do more than cowgirl, missionary, or doggystyle. I always had a lingering suspicion she wanted to try more than that, but anytime I brought up my willingness to figure out what she liked, she always shut down the conversation. And maybe that's what she liked and that's it, and my suspicion was brought on by my previous relationship where the girl was constantly wanting to try new things, so her being the first girl I ever had sex with made me think that all girls were like that, which isn't necessarily the case."

0,Don't forget that you'll lose your mind during the inevitable hiatus,Theneverendinghiatus,"A GUIDE TO THE STEVEN UNIVERSE FANDOM! (parody) STEP 1: THE FANDOM First of all, let's get you used to the fandom. This is the Steven Universe fandom, where leaks run rampant throughout the streets. You must first decide if you are okay with leaks or not. If you are, it's okay to keep using services such as YouTube, Reddit and the Internet. If you are not, go buy a cave with cable and Cartoon Network. This, however, poses some health risks, as accidentally seeing programs such as Uncle Grandpa or Teen Titans Go pose a serious chance of contracting cancer. This ends the tutorial for non-leak centric participants. STEP 2: PARTICIPATING So, you have decided to stay in the Steven Universe fandom. First, you have to decide what kind of fandomee you are. There are memers, aka only MKAtwood, the scrib... I mean ""ARTISTS"" , the actual artists, and, finally, the Theorists. Let's focus on the theorists, since everything else required ""skill"" or ""talent"" or whatever that crap is. Of course, becoming an actual theorist is no easy task either. That's why you're not going to be an actual theorists! STEP 3: BEING A ""THEORIST"" So how can you be a theorist and not be a theorist at the same time? Easy, by faking it! Most Steven Universe theorists are also quacks, so this should be easy. -Step 1: The Theory. -First, you need a theory. To start, pick a character, any one... how about Onion. Okay, next you need to pick a nebulous force in the show, or anything mysterious really. Let's go with the creation of the Gems. Next, let's plug these two completely separate ideas into this handy formula, ARE _____ AND THE _________ RELATED? Now that we have our theory, we need to share it with the world! -Step 2: Sharing. -Okay, now that you're theory is fully ""fleshed out"", it's time to share it with the fanbase. First, you need to go onto Google and download any somewhat related images to your theory. Literally anything remotely related will be okay. Next, open your free video editor of choice. Import all the images, in any order, into the video, and insert them for 3 seconds each. Next add subtitles to your video. Start with the first part of the theory, and go off on any random tangent until you hit the halfway mark of the video. Then start to talk about the other half, and repeat what you did for the first half. Add a single subtitle at the end that states the formula with the plugged in variables from Step 1. Export, and you are ready to release your content to the world! STEP 3: RELEASING YOUR VID It's finally time to become a part of the fandom like you've always wanted! First, publish your video on YouTube. Nothing matters more than the thumbnail, so go on to DevientArt, and find the first clickbaity Steven Universe image you see. Since this is the internet, free sharing of knowledge is okay, so download that sucker and save it to your computer. Next, monetize your video, and insert that clickbait you saved earlier. Set the title of your video to you're formula, and post it. Also, don't forget to add an ad before, after, and during the midpoint of your video. Now, wait for the views, subscribers and comments to roll in. Next, post a link to your video in every single subreddit related to Steven Universe. Send out several tweets about you're video, Snapchat posts, and Tumblr posts as well. Lastly, if any hurtful words, disguised as what they call ""criticism"", such as saying your video makes no sense and your video is just crappy clickbait, be sure to report them with all accounts you have, and try to delete their channel of you are a member of YouTube Heroes. After all, that's what those systems are for! CONCLUSION So, you've posted you're first piece of content. You may ask, ""what to do now?"". Don't worry, I have you covered. It's quite simple, actually. Just read this guide AGAIN! Simply pick different characters and forces every time, and follow the steps above, and you will be rolling in views, upvotes, and money! So go out there and start participating in the Steven Universe fandom today!"

This goes for most people in the world, if someone claims they are doing something(terrible) in the name of their religion, be in Christianity/Muslim/Buddhist or otherwise they are likely not a good example of that religion.

0,I LOVE LUKE AND I LOVE BASKETBALL AND FUCK THE CELTICS,sityclicker0,"Luke Walton Appreciation Thread Just 7 games in, you can already tell how much Luke and his staff have been able to completely turn around the outlook and culture of this team. The defense, much improved; the players who we thought were washed out, found new life; From playing uninspired, dead-end, bleak-outlook basketball the past two seasons to this young, fresh, and exciting brand of basketball that we've all enjoyed so far, has been nothing short of amazing. For me, the last 8 regular season games we've played easily beats out anything we've done the past three years as a whole. And can I just add about something from the game tonight regarding how he handled D'lo and the end of the game. It's no secret for 3 1/2 quarters, D'lo was utterly abysmal. He was a step behind everyone else, wasn't making shots, and playing porous defense. Then as the game went on in the 4th, the Suns/Booker just went off on a roll and we couldn't answer back to the point where they cut the lead down to 1 or so and poised to take the lead. Then Luke decides to put D'lo back in. To me, this shows how much Luke understands what this moment can mean for Russell and that he 100% believes in his player. What does D'lo do as soon as he comes in? Gets a fucking steal off of Warren that leads to him kicking out to Nick Young for the 4 point play in transition. As the game goes on, he gets a board, draws a HUGE offensive foul on Booker, then slowly helps to ice the game making free throws. I know on the stat-line it's not much, but the impact that moment will have on an impressionable budding star like Russell will be HUGE in the long run, and I bet you he'll forever remember that and light a fire of confidence in him. Anyways, Luke's man management has been top class in my opinion, and his trust to go with young players at testy times when he could easily have played the veterans who have been in these situations before, is the right decision in the long run for this organization. It's been such an emotional season for me so far and I can't wait to follow this team all the way through. I LOVE BASKETBALL."

1,Cordless charging with the active loop under the dogs mat?,DoneUpLikeAKipper,"You are assuming that the battery was conveniently fully charged before the dog escaped. You have 5 days of standby. At day 4, the battery is reduced to 20%. Now, you have 2 and a half hours of gps left. You also have a range of 10 minutes of the dog running away. And who knows how realistic the 'official' numbers are. 2 mile radius in a clear field or in the town? 12 hours gps in a laboratory with as little RF communication or in a real world scenario where it's cold (reduces battery life) and the RF keeps pinging updates. If we consider dogs, many of them are easily large enough to carry a more hefty collar. Old nokia phones had crazy long standby's right? And the thing is...phones are capable of geofencing just by using cell towers. That's what I do and many others do on androids. The phone is already in cellular standby to receive calls and sms. The phone constantly receives identifying information to which cell towers it's connected to. These towers are consistent. When I was home, I had the software record the cell towers and saved it as a 'location'. Any time those cell towers were detected, the phone would know I'm 'home'. That's how my phone turns on Wi-Fi when i get home. I could also set my phone up to send an sms if i leave home. The boundary of the home location is at the elevators of my apt building. This simple feature would be great for the dog collar. If it could automatically alert the owner that the dog left the 'home' location and then turn on gps by itself. Otherwise, you might come home from work and the dog has been gone for 8 hours. By then, it's way too far. I'm not suggesting that the dog tracker uses cellular or anything. Just pointing out that I could buy an android phone that would have more than 10 days of standby, with geofencing and when necessary it would turn on gps and give me its location data over cellular communication, infinite range. Makes you wonder why a custom made product is so feature-starved"

However, if we were to win enough to get to 2nd or later I think we should go with peppers. He and Garret are the two most athletic players in the draft and he could play S or nickel at a high level. I see people on here knock his deep coverage skills but he is not asked to cover deep very often and could easily be coached to develop this facet of his game. He has the speed to hang with almost anyone. Also, because of his size he can be matched up with a TE and take them out of the game. This is big for us because we are one of the worst teams in covering TEs. Because of his size speed and aggressiveness he can be a huge help against the run and also blitzing. He has shown great ability in blitzing and tackling in general. Finally, as a returner he is electric. If we draft him he is instantly the best secondary player we have and he is most athletic player on team with Pryor and coco. I know a lot of the OSU fans won't like this pick and people will continually knock peppers because of his ""subpar"" stats in coverage, but to say this is incredibly ignorant of what he does on the field."

I know you're embarrassed (which you really shouldn't be; you didn't do anything to cause this), but do you think you can ask her for five minutes to discuss how to prevent a situation like this from happening to anyone else in future? As for your ""friends,"" tell them if it was just a joke, they need to quit getting defensive about the fact no one is entertained but them, and apologize without excuses if they really want to move on from this.

The idea that a championship title would mean so much more to Cubs fans because they have a longer drought is so funny to me. The Indians have had an arguably much higher mountain to climb to get to this point, but everyone wants to act like the Cubs are eternal underdogs because the drought/curse narrative has perpetuated the concept that the Cubs have some other-worldly force working against them, and people believe it. The reality is that the Cubs and Indians droughts feel the same to their fans. Just because the Indians fans don't have all the lore doesn't mean their fans don't care as much."

Fallout 3 sold more than obilivion. Skyrim outsold Fallout 3 and so far I think for the same timeframe fallout 4 has outsold Skyrim. All the changes they make seem to be growing their sales and popularity. Just seems like you have nostalgia for how things used to be. This usually happens to most popular series.

I saw the spoilers today and I was excited by what I saw. I hope some of you feel the same. I know a lot of you wanted something different. I also like to set up a space for everyone to talk about the new LoC box themes! So here I am! The next box's theme is going to be DC Legacy. I'm honestly not 100% sure what that is supposed to mean but I'm assuming classic heroes like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. are gonna be represented. Along with their less heroic counterparts like The Joker, Catwoman, The Riddler, etc.. I always say this but I don't know if I'm gonna order this box. I still ordered the Batman Villains box on the last day. I really don't know what I could want in the Legacy box. There are already tons of Batmans. I do think Wonder Woman needs a new, updated mold with her her classic look. So what are you guys hoping for in regards to the Pop? What else would you want in the box? Who do you want on the tee (if there is one)??"

1,STOP VIOLATING MY SAFE SPACE,mijamala1,"Im about as anti-Trump as they come. I voted Bernie and I'm a great believer in liberal political agendas and their power to make the world a better place, like many of us on Reddit. But these protests and riotous behaviors make America, liberals, and millennials look so bad. We condemn the right for attacking and stonewalling Obama at every turn, yet turn around and do the exact same thing when Trump wins office. This is how American Democracy works, whether we like it or not, whether the system is broken or not, this is how it is and these people must accept that. Furthermore, maybe if the millennial generation would get to the polls with as much vigor and enthusiasm as they are using to riot and protest, perhaps then Trump wouldn't have won. I don't believe for a second that even 80% of these protestors voted against Trump or even voted in general. What a sad time in America. I don't want a Trump presidency, but I respect that he is our president and we need to come together as a country for once and work together. Stop rioting and start trying to set an example like Obama tried to and be bi-partisan, work with the Republicans. Otherwise, how can we expect anything different from them the next time a Democrat is elected? Let's set an example here, rather than simply falling to the level of GOP over the past eight years, rioting and stonewalling the President at every turn, it will only set us back further."

Then she told me about the last day/night she saw baby son and DIL. Baby (adult) son and DIL came to visit MIL for a day or two. I'm almost certain it was the son who used all the items in her kitchen to cook dinner for himself and his wife. Still don't think the mess was DIL's doing but maybe it didn't matter in the end. MIL comes home, sees a big mess in the kitchen. MIL told me it was all DIL's doing. I think DIL is the scapegoat in this. MIL goes to the spare bedroom, shakes DIL awake and says, ""Clean up this mess!"" Marches DIL to the kitchen to clean up the mess. DIL half awake is trying to clean up the kitchen but it wasn't good enough for MIL so MIL says, ""Here, I'll help you."" As if that makes MIL the good guy in this. She told me by morning they were gone without saying a word. NC to whole family and total blackout. She still doesn't know why her son did that.

1,TIL: modern weapons don't tear you to shred,sovietpandas,"I feel too many people want to end WW1. Lately I have been reading a good number of topics concerning changes people want to see in BF1. They range from customization, enhancements, and nerfing. I feel all of these are detrimental to BF1 and here is why. Now out side of glitch fixing these requests change the fundamental principal that is BF1, which is war back then sucked. There were no suped up rifles, planes were flying death traps, gas was every where, smoke filled your every pore, and bullets and explosives ripped you to shreds. So to say you want customized equipment is just plane anti BF1, you couldn't get it, it did not exist. Sure you could etch your name in your gun, but there not 100s of attachments, hell you'd be lucky just to have them not jam up. Same with enhancements. Planes sucked, asking for them not to be paper thin air jockeys is just wishful thinking. They were death from above from both angles. Now nerfing, this just boils my blood. Yes it's a game, a game in a genre full of games, full of bullet sponges games. This is a WW1 game, trying it's best to recreate that feel. To do that you have to die. Back then armor really did nothing, if you even had it. Helmets were more to make you feel better. Bullets tore you apart, Tanks crushed everything, and AA guns and cannons ruled all. To ask to nerf them takes away from the game. It would kill the feel, the setting, the drama. Millions died, not all of them could be Rambo and neither should we. We have other games for that, this one is trying something new. We can't have it two ways. You can have a WW1 game with a modern feel, it has to suck. It has to be living hell to play through, because that's what it was. We are suppose to slosh through the dirt, worry about the one bullet, and fear the sound artillery. Don't end the war before it even begins, instead bask in all its bloody glory. Look down your muddied sites, stare that gunner square in the eye, and say ""I know you can kill me in one shot, but damn it I'm coming for you any ways!"""

Battleborn was my game, my favorite game, for the time. I played the game non stop since the release, I've been through the good the bad and the ugly. I played the shit out of Battleborn and it never got old or soured the experience for me. Getting platinum trophy for PS4, and getting to level 100 within about 3 weeks after launch. I stayed with the game, while my friends left. I met new friends in which I played with. I created a YT channel for battleborn. But then I moved. 5 months ago. And where I moved, I didn't have internet (and still dont) which meant I couldn't play Battleborn. And I haven't played it since then. Until yesterday, when I played it for the first time since I moved. It was such a joyous experience. There was so much new content I was hyped all over again. Kid Ultra, who in my opinion is very to play as, and only midly cringy. And the OP missions, oh boy. Those are the kind of missions we should have had in the beginning. I can tell the Devs listened to the community and gave us what we wanted. The dialogue is so AMAZING, it's new, it's funny, it's soooo entertaining. And the addition of new characters is great too. Not to mention OP points were such a good idea, and a step in the right direction. The new game mode face-off seems awesome, although I haven't gotten the chance to play it, because I can't find it in the public matches. And the playlist, bird hunt, is a good deal of fun too. So, I'm having a blast with the game and I'm falling in love with it all over again. And I hope more people can have as good a time as I am having. Peace ~"

This makes using it in regular gameplay difficult and forces the nightstalker to jump into enemy lines of sight while firing the tether to avoid hitting scenery. The reason for this is first that the tether has a relatively large hitbox and second because there is an insane amount of slide that cannot be backed out of once in the super... Trying to tether round a doorway or through a reasonable sized gap against competent opponents is a ridiculously difficult task and I do not believe this should be the case. So, onto the suggestion: The way to stop this is simple.. Make the tether animation slide much less or lock you in place when used, allowing you to place the tether more consistently and removing the feel-bad moments of it sticking to a (parallel) wall on your left as it slides 2m left into it."

In 2004 I drank the 'conventional wisdom' Koolaid and just assumed he was a fringe kook - but in 2008 I actually started to listen to him during the debates and IMO he by far had the best ideas of all the candidates (and this included Obama and Hillary) But he was slaughtered by getting ZERO media attention in the primaries - so what world was Sanders living in when that was going on?

Fast forward a few years and it's in mainstream films and television, and ""cool"" people in New York have moved on. Few more years still and it's gauche in New York, mainstream in pop culture, and, still, the recalcitrant flyovers resist angrily. Finally, the children who grew up in flyover land seeing that trend on the VHS tapes are immunized and end up kind of falling in line with pop culture from 30 years ago, largely because by then their parents are too old and too weak from years of Culvers and Leinenkugel's to stop them. And in the meantime, that trend is also no longer gauche in New York because the oldsters have keeled over from AIDS, and the youngsters don't remember how gauche it once was. Right now we see midwesterners angrily denouncing the newfangled ""carl the cuck hipster nu-male glasses"" while gripping their wireframe glasses from Tom Cruise Mission Impossible as though it were just as important as their guns and bibles. And in the meantime youngsters from the coasts are embracing wireframe glasses as the next big thing. In about 15 more years, carl the cuck hipster nu-male glasses will be the epitome of God-fearing red-blooded Americanness, but for now, they are still a sign of encroaching gay AIDS patients who believe in cultural relativism and the destruction of American freedoms."

Considering how widely agreed upon this is and easy to implement these features would be, as well as mostly bug safe and in no way changing, compromising, or unbalancing game play, I don't understand why we haven't had more of this yet. Little things like: - Fireflies - Cricket noises - Twinkling stars - New music - All around new nature sounds - Butterflies (even as a particle cloud) - Wind blowing sounds at high Y-coord altitudes ^ All suggestions I've seen from other people that really are good and should be used. Not all of them, but some. Today, games are very heavily praised for the beauty and atmospheric aspects, even simple 2D pixelated platformers like Fez &amp; Superbrothers. While MC unique and we all love the awesome new features they're rolling out, Mojang would do well to realize that their player base will certainly appreciate sprucing up the feel of the game. People enjoyed MC sunsets way before shaders were a thing, so it doesn't take huge graphical updates and higher resolution looks (thats what shaders and texture packs are for), but small additions like the ones above that can make the game more aesthetically pleasing without changing the pixelated look we love!"

He can't just roll back changes without public participation. Also, the CAA/CWA allow for citizen suits to enforce regulations, so donate to the environmental group of your choice to fight any loosening of regulations. My former agency had a period where we had a very tentative agency head and it was very frustrating. I can't imagine working for a man who wants to dismantle most of these peoples life works...

1,Maybe that guy reads on the internet alot and was told that the Rift is seated only and you cannot stand up,Del_Torres,"Met a rift user for the first time in Onward So the match started, and I noticed that one guy was crouching at the start of the game. I asked him why he was sneaking at the beginning, and what he was doing. He said he was sitting. I said, ""comon lazy ass, stand up, haha."" Then I saw him again a few rounds later, still crouching and moving so slow. I asked him, ""Why are you sneaking from the start?"" He told me that he didn't know what the stand button was, and he was playing on the rift. I told him he needed to physically stand up in order to run, and he slowely got up, and was able to run. As soon as the match ended, I blurted out to all the guys how this guy thought there was a button to stand on the rift, but then instantly felt bad about it. In the next match I asked him if he had the 3 camera points, or 2. He told me he turned using the thumb stick, so he just stands facing forward, and turns using the controller. At that point, I realized that I don't have a grudge at rifters. I honestly just feel like the got jipped. I cant imagine Onward being nearly as immersive with thumbstick turning. It was an interesting revelation. I dont know how this has any relevance to a topic here on this subreddit, but I found it interesting. I really didn't think it would be quite like that for the majority of rifters, especially after all the rift evangalists that claimed the Rift would be equal in roomscale in every way. Oh well. I learned that there is no reason to snub their noses in not having roomscale or 360 degrees, now I just wish they were able to experience it as well. His perspective probably feels like only half of the true experience in games like Onward. He was a cool dude, and we had a good time. Maybe games like Onward will convince more people with the Oculus rift to purchase that third camera."

He did a lot of good, leadership wise. His policies (based on french revolution) ironically pushed the egalitarian cause in many nations forward by centuries. I think Montesquieu argued between a republic, monarch, and a despot: All three can actually work as long as a) the leader cares and b) the people choose it and follow through. The most likely to work is a republic... but our generations haven't needed to fight for it in a tangible way in a longgggg time. How would we? Media has us turned at each others throats.

I applied for the show last month, and it feels really good. I haven't gotten a call, or an email, but you never know I might still. Doesn't really matter. Back in March I had Orthodontic jaw surgery. Surgeon fixed my mouth breathing, my bite, it really changed a lot about me. The day after surgery I was sitting watching Survivor with my fam in the hospital. I was all hopped up on meds and I barely remember anything of Anna's boot last season. I remember sitting there and thinking ""I'm going to apply for this show when I recover and get my braces off"" That thought got me through a lot of shit. I lost 30 pounds due to a liquid diet, and was in a pretty lonely and bored place. I only had 1 class for my last semester of School, and I didn't work for 2 and a half months, so I spent a bunch of time home alone with my dog. In late October I got my braces off, and I knew it was time. Applying for the show was my goal, I took my time to make a video. My first few recording sessions were sooo bad. I ended up learning a lot about myself and making a video like this in the process. I accomplished a goal of mine, and I'm already thinking about what next years version is going to be different to help me stand out. What I really want to say to everyone here. APPLY for the fucking show. Pull out your cell phone and talk to it for 3 minutes about yourself, or going to an open casting call. If not this year (honestly pretty late), next will be fine, or apply to BB, or TAR. DOOO IT."

They think abortion is the **murder** of children. Ok, I get it. I get why people think Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She probably is. And I voted for her. But one thing I can not wrap my head around, I just can't understand, is how anyone could look at Trump's history and say ""He's not corrupt. He's going to clean up corruption."" It literally boggles my mind. And I have yet to have a Trump supporter actually explain to me their reasoning. Instead, they just talk about how corrupt Clinton is, usually using the equivalent of memes to prove it, and completely brushing aside Trump's two-bit ways."

1,ya I would much rather get killed by faster firing weapons from farther away.,crocfiles15,"With the recent communication about Shotguns from Bungie, here's my two cents. Make range and impact correlate inversely rather than directly. The only Shotguns worth a damn in PvP at the moment are the Matador 64, Party Crasher, and the old Conspiracy Theory. They all fall among the highest impact Shotguns in the game, as well as the ones with the longest base range. This is a problem, as they are the most likely to one shot kill due to their impact, and can do it at the longest range. This makes Shotguns as a whole seem too powerful, and leaves no place for low or medium impact Shotguns. If any of you play Battlefield 1, Dice is experiencing a similar problem, as the Model 10-A Shotgun has the highest damage and range, which leaves no room for its lower damage and faster firing counterparts. (How many times has the 10-A killed you vs the M97 or 12G Auto?) But how do you fix this specifically in Destiny? You make it so that having higher impact leads to a lower base range. If you want the more consistent one shot kill, you'll need to risk a bit more and get closer. If you want a relatively safe distance from just being punched to death, use the faster firing ones and risk needing a follow up shot or melee. This would also pave the way for the Chaperone to potentially have a role, as it is also currently overshadowed by the M64/PC+1. Now the reason that Dice hasn't done this is that Battlefield is a semi-realistic game, set in the real world, where more powerful weapons *do* tend to have more effective range. Bungie, in their sci-fi/fantasy setting, has the luxury of making tweaks like this. The biggest implications of this would be that in PvP, a low impact Shotgun shot followed by a long range melee (specifically Thunderstrike, and, to a lesser extent, Blink Strike) may be a bit too powerful. Right now, high impact Shotguns aren't the most consistent, and would need a slight damage boost to allow them to *reliably* OHK at said point blank ranges. In PvE, high impact Shotguns are already below low impact ones, and a range nerf wouldn't help, so they could serve to get a damage boost there as well. (As well as smaller boosts for all Shotguns in PvE because they're kinda lackluster IMO) Thoughts?"

Russia confirmed direct communications with the campaign. **journalists** Pizzagate: only Alt-Right pro Trump outlets take this seriously. Trump/Russia: only Alt-Right pro Trump outlets are not taking this seriously. **precedent** Pizzagate: pizza places that operate like comet are typically normal pizza places. Trump/Russia: politicians who operate like Trump are typically very corrupt. **transparency** Pizzagate: comet has welcomed investigation. Invited Pence to visit. Trump/Russia: tax records hidden. Ties denied/concealed. Manafort was fired for links but kept onboard on the downlow. **political response** Pizzagate: pols from both sides of the aisle have said this is baseless &amp; harmful Trump/Russia: pols from both sides of the aisle have called for investigation. Conflating the two issues is either evidence of a deep ignorance surrounding the two issues, or an intentional false equivalency intended to minimize Trump's conflicts of interest."

After Leman beat the ever living shit out of Magnus and Vulkan did his Vulkan thing they decided to pull back and leave us alone; I even had a catchy title for it ( By the Grace of the Golden Throne and Holy Terra). I had to go to be detained for a bit due to beating a pedophiles ass but the police and fellow detainees were sympathetic. So no Golden Throne, no Malcador, no Iron Cage. LF is in Texas now therefore leaving me with no adult supervision so I am going to tell you an incident report that doesn't have assholes going after my wife but after yours truly. So last month I was selling somethings online. Wacom, rifle parts, tactical gear, and plate carrier ( again I know but its a different one this time). I made a good take this time I have learned to weed out the airbeards and flakes. It appears after the election a lot of left leaning city folk want to learn how to use a gun and take care of themselves that way. Politics aside I think it's great they want to exercise the 2nd Amendment but I can not instruct them how so I refer them to my friends who do C&amp;C classes, But I sell them magazine pouches and such. Anyways I had a Wacom Intous for sale that caught the eye of: Bertha ( because this seems to be the only alias that fits her)- part time Tumblrina, part time gas station attendant, part time SJW, full time asshole. So like I said I have been pretty successful selling items on Armslist, Ebay and Craigslist. Bretha purchased the Intous tablet and I thought that would be it. However a week later I got an email from her saying check out her tumblr. I did out of morbid curiosity and what I got was a bunch of dude on dude drawings, nice girl ranting, etc. Not my cup of tea so I left it as is only to get another email asking if I enjoyed it. I told her no that her drawings and rants did not really do it for me and I was not into her kind of art style, anime of course, and I tell her I am glad shes enjoying the tablet but our business is done. I thought she got the hint until I see a message for my SPRAC carrier. It was Bertha asking about it and it was filled with well fuck here: He there jumper snake I was starting to take up airsoft and saw you sell a ton of things for that I saw the kawaii armor and thought it would fit me just fine. let me know cutey about it and I will buy it or maybe you can give me a discount ;) I had to clear the air. Bertha I am not going to sell you this and please leave me alone. Thank you for buying the Intous but I am a married man with a baby on the way. please leave me alone. OF course it is never that simple since not even 5 minutes after sending that I get an email from Bertha talking about how I misled her, how I didn't tell her about LF and LF Spawn, how I am a pig, how she'll be alone forever and such. I tell her in the most direct way that her problems are not mine and that she leave me alone. We all know that didn't happen."

You should lower it directly over your middle chest"". And I tried explaining to him that that's how you fuck up your shoulders, because the only way to bench like he advised to is by flaring your elbows. But it fell on deaf ears. He kept insisting and pushing, even though I explicitly told him I didn't agree with him. Since I only had 1 set left, I pussied out and gave in to try his way so I could get him off my back. Did one set with him controlling the bar path and felt uncomfortable as fuck. I told him this and he said ""That's because your using too much weight"". Fuck you and your retarded bench technique. Then again, he was hanging out with some bodybuilder-looking guy. And we all know bodybuilders usually train like retards, so I shouldn't be surprised. Next time he pulls something like this I'm gonna politely tell him I don't care about his advice. If that doesn't work, I'll just tell him to fuck off cause I didn't ask him shit."

Everyone was shocked and excited when the front-desk secretary called to say there was a package for me. I LOVE my gift, It's exactly the kind of thing I love and everyone agrees that it's the perfect gift cause it's so me. I can't stop smiling. Also, I was sure I would have to spend Christmas alone. Two other families had already invited me to spend it with them but I wasn't sure I wanted to. One family is very religious and I'm sure they will want to go to church etc. I'm an agnostic atheist and I'm not against church but I don't want to spend Christmas in one.

The license plate call, from a cell phone instead of his radio, has never made sense to me, unless he thought he had spotted the vehicle.

You're correct that the purpose of that document was to limit power, and specifically it was intended to enshrine individual freedoms. The bill of rights doesn't grant a single right - it enumerates specifics that no governmental authority can infringe upon. It limits government power in specific ways, and defines individual rights that are in-born. The Bill of Rights was a prerequisite to having the Constitution signed at all. It took some time to write it out, but was necessary in order to have the states participate at all. Most of those states already had an analog to the Bill of Rights already - the New York colony's original bill of rights included a version of the Second Amendment that expressly spelled out the need for firearms as a check against tyranny, for example, that was shortened considerably when the final version in the US Bill of Rights was ratified. Interestingly, the 10th Amendment - most important to the fledgling states that feared an all-powerful Federal Government - is now completely ignored."

1,bah fuck you and your logical arguments and knowledge of how the real world operates,PDXTony,"Someone somewhere is making piles of money off of everything you purchase. But your definition of piles isn't necessarily mine. The market sets prices for everything. Toyota makes piles of money. Same goes for GE, P&amp;G, Shell, Exon, DuPont, Apple, even Amazon. Simple logic: the new owner will probably clear $100-200 per door after everything settles at market and financing is set. So if this is a 9 unit building, that's $900-$1800/month. That's not a pile of money. There are a shit ton of expenses that people refuse to acknowledge with rentals. Property tax, insurance, maintenance, capitol expenses, property management, vacancy allowance, etc. Rule of thumb is that these should be about half of your monthly revenue. Then that other half needs to pay for your principal and interest payment. Whatever is left is your ""pile of money"". And for another thinker, if this property is as run down as they say, the new owner probably used private or hard money to get it under management and repositioned to be financeable with a traditional bank held mortgage. Meaning he could be paying 5-10% interest and literally making nothing until it's refinanced. It's a business. It was purchased based on market prices, otherwise it wouldn't have been sold. It is an asset that needs to make money. Unless you or someone else wants to subsidize it, the market will set the worth."

1,"season 1 in a week?pff, i was done with 1-5 in 3 days",chidoSer,"Thoughts on Season 1 (Spoilers Main) First of all, wasn't sure which tag to use so sorry if its mis-tagged. I have just recently started to watch the show and was almost immediately floored by how amazing the show was. I was hooked on the first episode and downed the first Season within a week, absolutely enthralled by the world that was built. Since a lot of people here are veteran watchers/readers I think I will give you all a taste of what I, a outsider, thinks of the seasons as I get through them. * **The Characters**: I think the characters are by and large the best characters ever portrayed on television. They feel alive and like they actually have had a life before the events of the show, not just poofing into existence. I think their pre-show life is more enhanced by the fact that they don't spout long exposionary shpeels about this and that. They talk off handedly about previous events to other people because THEY LIVED THROUGH IT TO! It gives us, the outsiders, tantalizing glimpses into the past that we havent (and won't) see. For example, Roberts Rebellion. As far as I can tell, in S1 they never sit you (or a person in the show) down and go about explaining the whole thing. They simply talk about it when its relevant and about the parts relevant to their present conversation. In the first episode King Robert talks to Edd about it, but not for long. They simply drop hints that it happened and it happened partly because of Edd's sister, who Robert loved (which is sweet :'D). Then they kinda sprinkle hints about the Mad King Aerys, about how mad he was, what he did and how he started the Rebellion. They are also likable and hatable, something some shows struggle to achieve (I like Tyrion the most). * **The Lore**: The Lore, at least personally, is probably the most interesting part of the series for me becasue it feels like it actually happened before the show and wasn't written up in some small room a few days before a deadline. I am a man of history and love to study it. I like to know *why* things happened just as much as *how* they happened, and GoT delivers. They talk about the Long Winter and how it lead to the creation of the Knights Watch. They talk about the history of the Khal's and how they don't cross water their horses can't. They also focus on the smaller points of their history. For instance when Tyrion is surrounded by the Hill People of the Veil and he talks (albiet briefly) about their suppression by the Knights of the Veil. Like previously stated they talk about Roberts Rebellion. They talk about the destruction of the Targaryen Family after Roberts Rebellion. Its just so vibrant and alive I love it! * **The Plot(s)**: Of course the plot is enthralling, and not just the main thread about who sits on the Iron Throne. What mostly intrigues me is the unveiling one about the King Beyond the Wall and the return of the White Walkers, the end of the Long Summer. There is so much more going on just under the surface that it always forces you to keep your ears open, just like someone in Westeros would, just in case something happens while you aren't paying attention. Every single one of them are also interesting which begs for your attention and gets it handedly if your keen enough to notice them all. * **How Graphic it is**: This can mainly be attributed to the more or less nonexistent censorship of HBO. Still, I like it that I can see a man get is throat slit and watch all the blood pour out rather than have a jump cut just before the gore starts. The most bloody scene I liked was when they executed Ned, the blood dripping down the executioners sword was a cool shot to say the least."

1,"Houston sucks, don't move here.",slabhtine,I am looking at relocating to houston from austin I made my way to Houston this past weekend to look for a place to live. Last time I was here was in 1999 I am going to be working downtown so I was looking at a few places downtown to midtown. All and all i was happy with what i found. After I narrowed it down I decided to take a walk around. I asked the places if it was safe I have dogs and need to be able to walk them. Most said its fine just the occasional people asking for money. I decided to hop on the train running form midtwon to downtown walk a bit see some of the parks. Now I have read previous posts that said police were making a bigger presence. I did not see this at all. On the train down I was asked for money 3 times and for my phone once. This was a short ride I was surprised. Walking around and this is in the after noon on a Saturday it felt very sketchy to me . Heading back on the train to my car there was a group of 4 homesless that got on the train one was really tweaking out making finger guns at everyone the others were talking about how they were gonna kill the guy sleeping on there bench at another station. Now I read all about the trian how you have to have a ticket and if you get caught without one its 500 dollar fine. Is there a rule that homeless get to ride for free? Is downtown really getting better? The draw of the parks and downtown life is great but if im gonna be dodging getting mugged every time I go for a burger maybe i should look elsewhere.

1,Not dying,yugiohhero,"The Key to streaking? I have been playing Enter The Gungeon since release and absolutely love it but have one question and possible gripe with the game, streaking. In other games with similar gameplay styles like The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne I find myself able to beat the game multiple times in a row and go on streaks, but in this game killing the (real) final boss happens once in a few runs and seems to depend more on luck than actual skill. I want to improve at the game and have watched some people that can streak, but after watching them play for run after run I cannot seem to pinpoint what it is that makes them so prone to streaks. I think I play well but seem to have bad luck with the items I get and in this game it doesn't seem viable to outplay bad item drops like it is in Isaac or Nuclear Throne. One thing I think must help is knowing what situation to use weapons in, whether it be as a boss weapon or a room clear. Other than that do you guys have tips to streak in this game? What is your highest streak? What is your biggest tip? I really do love this game and hope to get much better at it before the supply drop update drops."

Most were against it and wanted it shut and then the right started theri games of scaring people and Obama was going to make your grandmother house terrorists and each one would make nuclear bombs in your grandmothers basement, cats would rape dogs.. etc. and it worked. Doesnt matter we have super max prisons that can even hold former heads fo state safely. And we haev scumbags that are just as scummy as any of these terrorists.

You're dumbing down your competition while elevating your own side. Death threats? How about actually getting gassed for having a meeting? Getting stones thrown at your booth? Being driven out of town by the threat of violence? Having people show up to a speech and staring to get violent? These are things that have happened to SD. And PC isn't problematic for being nice, it's problematic for censoring people. If there's a good chunk of the population that doesn't want immigration of this level, but can't discuss it because of the social climate, then that is a problem. They're not being represented and their opposing ideas are being cast off without much consideration leading to a very one sided political world. If a politician can't take an opposing position if he sees it as reasonable, because it will ostracise him, that's a problem. PC culture is also criticized for being regressive in some areas, quotas are one thing usually brought up as discrimination rather than equality. People being discriminated against and having it held up as progressive is a danger. Safe spaces, promote echo chambers which again are detrimental to a good climate of discussion. I don't disagree with the notion of being polite, or the equality of my fellow men, but i don't want it at the expense of other things."

1,So ... what I'm hearing is that we are all going to die because corporations are greedy.,eigenfood,"It's a hypothesis derived not from the direct forcing of CO2, but of the amplication feedback effects from that initial warming of extra CO2 in the atmosphere. An example would be albedo reduction. When light from the sun enters the atmosphere, CO2 doesn't interact with most of it. That light hits the land / water and warms it. The Earth then radiates that heat away through blackbody radiation. This is in the infrared spectrum. CO2 does interact with IR radiation, absorbing it and reradiating some of that energy back out. In random directions. Some back to space, but some back to Earth (where without CO2 it would all go right to space). That's the basic theory of greenhouse gases, well understood. The amplification effect from albedo is where a reflective surface bounces that initial sunlight away from Earth before being absorbed. At the same wavelengths it came in at, so CO2 doesn't trap it. The most common source of albedo is ice. More warming = less ice = more warming = less ice, etc etc. The good news is while there are many positive amplifications, the net of feedbacks is unclear, because there are negative feedbacks too that diminish the overall warming. The most critical is the exponential of blackbody radiation. As temperature increases, the amount of heat radiated away increases by a factor of 4. So if the Earth warms up, it'll push more energy out. Without that physical reality, we'd be screwed. The crux of this whole issue is we really don't know exactly how much warming we will get from the extra CO2 we've added to the atmosphere. Without feedbacks the IPCC states that warming directly from CO2 doubling in the atmosphere is about 1 degree celcius globally. The IPCC states the likelihood is the net of feedbacks is positive, but the range is very broad. Between 1.5C to 4.5C of total warming is possible. The high end of that range would be really bad, the middle range would be problematic but adaptable, and the low end would yield little consequence. Of course, even the effects of the warming we aren't sure we'll get are uncertain. That's the main problem with how climate change is discussed in science and most predominantly the media, everything is stated as a certainty. No discussion of the uncertainties, vagueries and probabilities of anything. That is misleading by omission. The best bet for any of us is to remain calm and do our best to adapt to whatever happens, good, ugly or catastrophic, it's coming. We're humans. We're good at survival. In fact, we're the best species in the universe at it. (That we know of)."

I look at it like an obese person who dieted down to their normal BMI but is continuing to diet as if they have weight to lose, now they are becoming anorexic and developing body dysmorphia by pushing a bunch of non-issues instead of trying to create a sustainable program. Really what would be a good place for feminism to go would be to put pressure on the foreign countries that still subjugate their women, countries were women can't vote, get acid thrown in their face, can't go out without a family member male at their side, get genital mutilation, etc. On top of that feminism needs to work on creating more female role-models in the media that aren't all about fashion, dieting, and having a nice booty. Its not a bad thing to like those things, but lets be real there aren't nearly enough women involved in politics, science, literature, or art that get recognition in media or are propped up as strong women to look up to. All these little girls looking up to Kim Kardashian is doing more to hurt feminism than any fat hate can ever do."

It's amazing how people having a quarter of a ton of adipose tissue like to argue about people being 10 lbs. overweight, and that they're being body shamed. No one is body shamed for having 10 lbs extra. People are body shamed for being 1000 lbs overweight and starting to merge skin with their couch upholstery."

There are a good amount of high level mystic players in my town also, and I know some work together, but no one is taking steps to dismantle some of these gyms. I'm level 31 with alot of great attackers, I could spend an hour and alot of potions and revives to take a level 10 gyms, but only one for all that work, and would be taken back from me by mystic or valor within 10 minutes.
