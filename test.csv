0,"YES Or, small/medium troops around 6-7 tiles, and push large troops like Pekka, Giant, etc around 3-4 tiles because they are larger and heavier, which makes sense.",xEpicChaosx,"A buff that will truly make the log get into legendary statues Nowwe all know the log needs its love. Supercell say they will make the log push even the heaviest of units like pekkas and golems. However, I think that change won't really help the card reach popularity. So I looked up the card, and it's travel distance says 9.6 tiles, so one change I had in mind is..... What if the log push back all units, a full 9.6 tiles. That would be a huge buff and I think this change will make the log a more appealing choice in terms of deck building, or choosing which legendary card should I spent my 40k gold on.....? The log just can't compete with the other popular legendaries like ice wiz, miner, and the recent buff and amazing lumberjack. Think about it, your opponent has the pekka locked onto the tower, you can use the log to push her all the way back to the river and distact her with guards or goblins. Another scenario is a hog rider. By selecting the log, you pushed him back a 9.6 tile radius and when he comes back again you can use your cannon that was out rotation. Idk if this will make the log op. But this can make the log one of the best defensive cards in the game and a good offensive to stop those barbs and mini pekkas. It will make deck builders more complex when it comes down to which spell they wanna run. As a legendary card, the log should be the best spell card in the game. If this change is too much maybe I recommend increase the elixer cost to 3 or 4 elixer. Supercell IK the update is almost here so if any other balance changes is coming plz consider this. It will go very well with your upcoming log buff that pushes even pekkas and golems. Plz give your thoughts down below. Its time that the log deserve love."

I'm in favor of opening up healthcare to all, in order to provide poor folks access. But really, that's only half of the problem.

Can we require folks, or at least teach them how to make lifestyle changes before they develop diabetes, lung cancer, obesity, clinical depression, heart disease, or any of the pathologies that run rampant in a sedentary, packaged-food culture. Get that tooth looked at early before you run into a dental emergency with an abscess swelling your entire face. Exercise a little more. Get a cholesterol test and a damn flu shot. Do those things and you'll feel better, plus it'll save all of us taxpayers money in the long run.

Get boots into mana boots, he needs mana bad. Wind Lace is great too. If I am playing a 4 I also like to get orb of venom, combined with his punches and leech seed it's very easy to get kills. You can get an iron talon as well, it can help you get a bit of farm and also deward. Next get blink. I see a lot of people rush aghs with tree, but the thing is blink is just SO good on him by comparison. You can blink from tree to tree remaining invisible, makes it easy to scout out enemy jungle and deward. It also makes setting up his ult so much easier. After that, it depends how much farm you get. I usually find that by the time I farm an aghs the game is almost over anyways, and to get the full benefit of it you need around 10 minutes of placing trees.

Not sure if anybody else has had the same experience playing over the past couple days, but since autofill has been enabled for everybody, all the time, the quality of my games has dropped substantially due to people getting autofilled and either not taking the game seriously, or outright trolling. I've had games where the support afks at 10 minutes, because they don't like their ADC and they don't want to take the game seriously. I even had a game where the ""Support"" refused to take the role and went duo top. This is something I hadn't seen even a single time since position selection was added, until this week. Then you have the horribly mismatched lanes, where a top/jungle main gets stuck as a support against an actual support player, which anecdotally seems to offset any gains in matchmaking that autofill offers. This might just be my perception and not grounded in reality, though. I'm really disappointed because I thought position select was one of the big successes of Season 6, but it feels like it's basically back to how it was in Season 5, since there's almost always at least one autofilled player in every game now."

She asked me again, and I answered that it was on sale, for ten dollars off. It's $29.99, regular price, and $19.99, sale price. She asked me what the point of having a sale was, if that's all she would get off. She tried to use a coupon, but our coupon that was valid on sales items ended at noon and her other coupon was only valid on regular price items. I explained to her that she couldn't use either, and she lamented the point of having a sale again. Finally, I rung up her daughter whose item was not on sale and I gave her a forty percent coupon. And then she was like, why didn't you give me a coupon? while looking at me like I was the dumbest person alive. And I just snapped at her because I was like, we've fucking been through this before. 'Because her items are regular price and yours are not.'"

So its around 8:20 and i see some lady walking around buying stuff so i walk up to her and say ""miss were closes your gonna half to leave"" and she looked at me shocked and says ""really? Is that why the entrance doors didn't open?"" In my head i was like wtf. But as I'm telling her you gotta leave because there are no cashiers left to check you out and she starts flipping out saying we can not refuse to server but we cant serve someone 20mins after we are closed and all the cashiers have left. So after arguing for 5 more mins she finally leaves after she finally realizes there is no one to help check her out."

Similarly it reduces the amount of political capital Trump has at his disposal. If he won by 5 million votes people might be more willing to go along with what he says. When he wins with a 3 million deficit representatives can more easily oppose him.
0,And this would be why I would honk as well,SecksAwhnThuhBeech,Yeah this guy had slowed down and stopped well before the merge point after exiting a highway (with highway speed traffic behind him). He could have easily merged if he maintained his speed and used the whole merge lane instead of stopping at the beginning of the merge lane for no reason. Stopping unnecessarily after exiting a highway is just asking to be rear ended.

But, his past transgressions have included a sort of acceptance of an endorsement from David Duke, insulting a Gold Star family, various offensive comments about Mexicans, the Alicia Machado affair, tweeting an anti-Semitic picture of Clinton and many more. Yet, why has this revelation gained traction considering his past, arguably worse, transgressions? Why is this the issue that may end his campaign and cause the GOP to firmly turn against him?"

I have this school project where I have to make a plan of how I'd start a business of my own. I decided I'd start a clothing store called Queer Clothing! We would sell gender neutral and also more masculine type and more feminine type clothes and accessories. We'd have no ""women's"" or ""men's sections"". Anyone could just buy any items they like without needing to worry about passing or what other people think! T-shirts with and without cool LGBT+-prints. A clothing store for anyone LGBTQ, ally or just someone looking for an adrogynous style! Now that I've quickly introduced the idea to you, I'd need you to answer the following questions and also put your age &amp; gender along with the answer. This gallup is a part of the project! 1. Do you think we'd need this kind of a clothing store? Why? 2. Is there something about the idea that could be improved or do you have something to add to the idea? 3. What do you think about the name of the business? 4. Would you go shopping here? Do you think you'd buy something from here? Your answers would mean a lot to me! Help me not fail this assignment!"

There was an anti-theist undercurrent that developed when Intelligent design popped up, (or perhaps even before, it's easy to be resentful when everybody in your community expects you to be Christian) while the War on Terrorism made open islamophobia from anti-theism acceptable.

So, I guess in that sense MBTI can be like astrology: either a person is looking to improve and grow, or they're looking to rationalize and excuse their maladaptive behavior, and whether they do that with MBTI, astrology, ""which care bear are you"" tests, or whatever, they're going to do it."

She had told the PO that she had quit, they reported they'd fired her for no-call no-show.

A: No Q: So when you say you quit, you really just stopped going to work one day? A: Yeah Q: And if they say they fired you because you didn't show up and didn't let them know, are they saying pretty much the same thing? A: Well, I quit, but yeah, I guess. I've come to the conclusion it's almost a cultural thing. Your parents probably never sat down and told you ""if you have a job, and you don't want to go anymore, you have to tell them you quit,"" But you learned it somewhere. But there are significant numbers of people for whom that's just something that's like a mind-blowing revelation. They've never heard it before."

I watched their kids grow up. I moved interstate with them when we went from Qld to Vic. They were about 23 or so when they did this first. They gave me friendship and stability and a home I desperately needed. I lived with them until I got married - almost 7 years. I was their ""little brother"" and ""big brother"" to their kids. All that to say, never ever underestimate the power of availability. They were total introverts. A party for us was hanging out together outside in the summer with coffee and talk and maybe a guitar or two. We knew more about Aquinas than we did local news. There is power in love, despite the temperament it is channeled through. I really hope you blow the doors off as you live out your calling. It can change (and save) lives!"

Hodges; feel free to replace 'gay marriage' with whatever other minority issue you like). The people who are **for** gay marriage aren't saying 'everyone should go out and find themselves a nice homosexual to settle down with'. They're saying, 'We want you to care about the fact that we currently *can't* do this thing that you take for granted'. People who aren't in minorities need to be actively **for** minority issues, because otherwise nothing will change, which doesn't affect you but does affect a significant number of people who, say, couldn't marry their long-term partner until the law passed. Saying 'I have zero opinion about it' is the equivalent of saying 'I've got mine, Jack'. If you think it's something that everyone should be able to do, the people who *don't* have theirs could really use your support."

0,"IT department, so hot right now!",xbcsmith,"Fuck Ad blockers- NEW DELHI: Amendments to the I-T laws do not seek to tax inherited gold and jewellery as also those items that are purchased through disclosed or agriculture income, the government said on Thursday. The Lok Sabha earlier this week passed the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, which proposes a steep up to 85 per cent tax and penalty on undisclosed wealth that is discovered by tax authorities during search and seizure. Dispelling rumours that jewellery would be covered under the amended law, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said the government has not introduced any new provision regarding chargeability of tax on jewellery. ""The jewellery/gold purchased out of disclosed income or out of exempted income like agricultural income or out of reasonable household savings or legally inherited which has been acquired out of explained sources is neither chargeable to tax under the existing provisions nor under the proposed amended provisions,"" the CBDT said. During search operations, conducted by I-T department, there would be no seizure of gold jewellery and ornaments to the extent of 500 grams per married women, 250gm per unmarried women as also 100gm per male member of the family, it said. ""Further, legitimate holding of jewellery up to any extent is fully protected,"" it added. The Bill, which is currently under consideration of the Rajya Sabha, will amend Section 115BBE of the Income Tax Act to provide for a steep 60 per cent tax and a 25 per cent surcharge on it (total 75 per cent) for black money holders. Another section inserted provides for an additional 10 per cent penalty on being established that the undeclared wealth is unaccounted or black money, taking the total incidence of levies to 85 per cent. Top Comment How about the reddy brothers? Has govt notices the recent extravagant marriage celebration they conducted? Has the gold worn by the reddy family women missed the govt''s eyes or it is turning a blind... Read Moretruthconscience81 CBDT said: ""Tax rate under section 115BBE is proposed to be increased only for unexplained income as there were reports that the tax evaders are trying to include their undisclosed income in the return of income as business income or income from other sources. ""The provisions of section 115BBE apply mainly in those cases where assets or cash etc. are sought to be declared as 'unexplained cash or asset' or where it is hidden as unsubstantiated business income, and the Assessing Officer detects it as such."""

I assumed it was for another baby shower invitation or something, so I didn't ask questions or hesitate to give it to her. Come to find out... she's in the Relief Society Presidency and was going to make contact with the ward I should be in now to try to get them to come to house to encourage me to come back. Apparently, she asked my mom for it and told my mom about her intentions, and my mom pretended she didn't know my exact address (go Mom!)... but my Mom didn't think to tell me about this conversation. I'd love to hear some good advice of what I should do if the missionaries come. Don't answer? Pretend it's the wrong place?

I'm imagining the self-righteous and applauded photos of people showing off their rural settlement. If we all lived in such a way, there would be no countryside--as the article alludes to. Cities, if dense enough, are ironically more sustainable in that economies of scale are reduced, land outside of the city can be preserved for parks and--more importantly--agriculture."

0,Can confirm ADC just feels bad to play compared to every other role.,Izunas,"The sad state of ADC Marksmen are having serious issues right now. Now more than ever, we are seeing so many of these ""life of an adc"" clips of carries being destroyed without a chance of fighting back. But not only that, many people (including me) have ditched the role. So many games I see spiraling out of control even before I can finish Ezreal's 2 items, which is one of the cheapest 2 item builds of any adc (IBG/Tear, even TriForce/Tear is fairly cheap). You end up having to flip a coin every game on who will win early, unless you can get really fed in lane, and even then you are under constant pressure never to be caught and never to make a mechanical mistake in fights, else you may throw the game by yourself. So what is happening here? Fervor is no longer a viable option for any marksman outside of Ezreal and fringe cases of Twitch and maybe Lucian, making Warlords the only option for most carries who can't use DFT (ignoring TLD corki, but he's kind of and odd one anyways). Itemization has been nerfed since the preseason (I.E. has 5 less crit chance and still less AD making it a much less efficient first item purchase and a weaker second item. While shiv and RFC are arguably better, they still aren't good enough which is why we see many carries going for Phantom Dancer instead. The class has been nerfed as a whole since the preseason, not only due to item changes but also meta shifts. Elementary drakes made early game power much more important, where adcs just can't match up against the Syndra's and Oriannas who have really powerful 1-2 item spikes at cheaper gold costs compared to the 3800 price tags, and most classes now have very effective item choices (which is a good thing). The class as a whole needs a bump. Either making Fervor a better option for carries, potentially removing it as an option or making it less efficient for Fighters (6 stack cap, remove double stacking for melee?) or simply make the items more valuable, make the stat gap easier to bear (tiny hp pools/armor growths) or give back the defensive options that were stripped away 1 by 1 (Sterak's nerf for squishies, Maw nerfs, QSS nerfs? but to be fair those were fair and ended up balancing out). Something needs to be done, so marksmen can attempt to keep up early game and not end up getting so easily outpaced."

The knee-jerk Get Tough approach is a failure. Remember India's long game. Pakistan has lost control of its own groups. Pakistan is now victim of their own monster that they have created. The price they have paid is a lack of FDI, CPEC is not going as well as they hoped thus far. India got over 50B USD in FDI last year, Pakistan got something like 1.5B. They are borrowing money like there is no tomorrow from all the major agencies. Their GDP per capita growth is atrocious. On top of this, India can and should move to make sure they don't get any US aid at all. Play hardball with the yanks. They are desperate enough to be on the good side of India, use that to India's advantage. They are already moving to that anyway. By supporting Balochistan and now even Sindh separatist groups, India is causing much more social unrest than Pakistan could ever hope to do. Never forget the long-term aim, to become so dominant of South Asia, economically, politically and geostrategically, that Pakistan becomes little else but a minor irritant. Pakistan knows this, it knows it has no counter to the grand strategy so it tries to drawn India in with these sorts of attacks to overreact. Thus, it can deflect attention away from a failed and overindebted economy with meager results and with a rising domestic militant problem. India should play hardball, but do so in a disciplined manner. Giving way to knee-jerk responses, especially pronounced by people like Christine Fair who has zero skin in the game and likes being a hawk when other people have to bear the cost of that advice, is foolish."

However, Pico is also considered a pretty easy climb by alpine standards and one of the members of our group who has done the climb already thinks the skiing should be pretty straightforward. As a competent but not exceptional skier (fine on steep blacks, a little sketchy on doubles), I want to get some more perspectives from others who have climbed."

(Because I was really bored) Abathur - Soma Transference, increased healing on Spike Burst. Alarak - More targets to hit with lightning for more healing, both quests at level 7 are completed much more easily, can cause counterstrike to trigger. Anub'arak - Increased healing from Locust Swarm Artanis - Increased trait CD reduction from Q Arthas - Level 1 Eternal Hunger quest (although not that hard to complete even without samuro, so not that big of a deal) Auriel - Increased energy gain from Q and Ult, as well as the Q quest at 1, gives her a heroic target to auto attack to get loads of energy from Energized Cord at 7. Azmodan - Sieging Wrath quest at 1 Chen - Accumulating Flame at 1, Keg Toss at 4 Cho - Blazing Bulwark at 1, Runic Feedback at 13, Twilight Veil and Frenzied Fists at 16. Gall - Spurred Onward at 1, Double Trouble at 4, Dread Shield at 13. Chromie - Both Q and W quests at 1, can keep up Shifting Sands stacks easier at 16 (14) Dehaka - Symbiosis at 7 Diablo - 2 extra runes on the ground from Apocalypse E.T.C - Level 20 upgraded Stage Dive Falstad - Gathering Storm at 1 Gazlowe - Extra TNT, Ark Reactor Greymane - Incendiary Elixir Gul'dan - Pursuit of Flame, Echoed Corruption at 1, Bound by Shadow at 7, Fel Armor and Harvest life at 13, Rampant Hellfire at 16 Illidan - Battered Assault at 1, Unbound at 4, Hunter's Onslaught at 7, Metamorphosis at 10, Elusive Strike at 13, Blades of Azzinoth at 16. Johanna - Eternal Retaliation at 4, Holy Renewal at 16 Kael'thas - Potential for huge Living Bomb spread, Convection at 1, Burned Flesh at 7, Flamethrower at 20 Kerrigan - Increased trait generation from W, E, R and Psionic Pulse / Fury of the Swarm at 4 Leoric - March of the Black King, Consume Vitality at 16 Medivh - CDR on Q, The Masters Touch at 7, potential for huge Poly Bomb spread Muradin - Perfect Storm at 1, Healing Static at 13 Nazeebo - Widowmakers and Pandemic at 1 Nova - Sniper Master at 7 Ragnaros - Massive healing from Q, Sulfuras Hunger and Shifting Meteor at 1, Fire Ward at 4, Hand of Ragnaros and Molten Power at 7, Cauterize Wounds and Tempered Flame at 13 Rehgar - Rising Storm at 16 Samuro - Way of Illusion and Way of the Wind at 1 Sonya - Increased Whirlwind Healing Stitches - Savor the Flavor at 7 Sylvanas - Lost Soul at 4 The Butcher - More opportunity to use Butcher's Brand Thrall - Increased trait return on Sundering and Earthquake Tychus - In the Rhythm at 7, and That's the Stuff! at 13 Tyrande - Empower at 1 Valla - Creed of the Hunter and Puncturing Arrow at 4, Siphoning Arrow at 13, Death Siphon at 20 Varian - Lion's Maw and part of High King's Quest at 1 Xul - Flowing Wounds at 13 Zarya - Demolitions Expert at 1, Clear Out at 20 41/59 of the current heroes can get value out of Samuro's clones I might have missed some, but sorry for the super long list, just needed to burn some time and educate people on how to make Samuro players mad."

The military offers a great ""reset"" button for people who have a small amount of student debt, or people who don't really know what they want to do as a career just yet. The military is not all war, blood, guts and killing. Sure, if you pick a combat MOS you're likely to be subjected to some emotional trauma/PTSD, but there are so many other career paths within. From technical jobs, mechanical roles, LE roles, criminal investigators that reside stateside, etc. Not to mention that a lot of government jobs in the U.S. use a ""veteran preference points"" system to assist with veterans finding employment after they are discharged from active duty.

0,"Interesting story, right on.",wezbrook,"My academic history is proof that sleep and overall ""home-life"" is super important in terms of grades. I was placed with a random roommate my junior year in a tiny 14'x16' room. The entire thing was shared space so there was never any privacy, and we got the full experience of each other's presence. For that entire year, he interrupted my sleep every single night. Whether it was him coming back drunk at 3am, him firing up the microwave for a 4am snack, him slamming the door in the morning before his 8am class, or THE LOUDEST SNORING I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE, I didn't get a good night's sleep for an entire school year. My average GPA for that year dropped by almost an entire point. As soon as I moved into a new place and got my own room the following year, my GPA went back to her former glory. Yes, class difficulty and other factors played a role, but I really feel that I didn't have a fair shot at tackling the tougher classes at my full strength because I was too tired all the time. That year taught me two things: I need my own private space and I need to speak up and demand what is mine. Room changes are extremely unlikely which is why I never pursued that route, but I should have demanded and nagged until I got one. Since that year, I've begun thinking more about myself and what I want rather than trying to make everyone else happy all the time. It's good advice for some."

0,1-3 I'm with u 1000% I'm too worried about another Osweiler and Matt Cassell situation to spend draft picks on Jimmy G.,TakeOutFromHooters,"1. Zach Brown, ILB with the Bills. He's had a great year, and is young. The Bills are up against the cap, and have no reasonable chance of signing him. This move would essentially fix the ILB position. 2. Find a guard in free agency. Chance Warmack perhaps? Doing so allows you to move Beadles over to C full time with Kilgore, and the two of them can hash it out for playing time. 3. John Simon OLB Houston. He will not be sought after, and isn't starter quality. He is a leader, and if he is the worst OLB on your roster, you are doing something right. He can earn snaps. 4. Figure out what in the hell you are doing at QB. Trade for Jimmy G? Draft a guy? I don't know, but you'd better figure that out."

So, since we know Stands are extensions of one's fighting spirit and psyche, I've been wondering what would happen to someone's Stand if they completely changed as a person? Let's say, the individual has a Stand based on helping others (and that's his mentality too), but lives through a traumatic experience, and gets changed completely as a person, what he stands for, his personality, views on things, psyche and mental state etc. Let's say he becomes violent and emo, and instead of wanting to help people, he gets violent and wants to kill everyone. Would his stand change with him to something more Killer Queen-esque or would it stay the same?

I have prepared four 5 gallon buckets and drilled holes in them, and plan to use cardboard and coffee grounds as a substrate. I'll be growing in a spare room that stays at about 60-70 degrees year round. I'm looking for spawn from the easiest variety of oyster mushrooms to grow in cardboard/coffee grounds. For whatever reason I am having a hard time finding a good source for oyster mushroom spawn in sawdust or grain. Lots of plugs, but I am under the impression that plugs are only really appropriate for growing in logs. Anybody have a reasonably priced, quality source of oyster mushroom spawn they can recommend to me? Also, how much spawn do I need for four five gallon buckets filled with cardboard and coffee grounds? Thanks!"

I'm at the (first?) tailing mission and it's infuriating because it only saves at the beginning of the drive to go FIND the target, and then doesn't save when you actually catch sight of him at the bar (even though there's a cutscene here), so if you fail you have to do the initial drive from the acquisition of the mission all over again.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD My theory is that in the classic book/movie *1984*, Oceania is not a world-spanning superstate like it is described, but is simply a delusional dictatorship controlling the former United Kingdom and nothing else. Some evidence for this: -Winston never sees any real proof of Oceania's existence outside Airstrip One. -""The Book"", which assures the existence of the 3 superstates, was written by the Ministry of Truth, therefore it's unreliable. -The photo of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford in New York could've easily been forged. -It is stated somewhere (I can't remember where) that the rocket bombs falling on London are fired by the Party itself and not Eurasia. -Given what O'Brien said about plastic surgeons being able to transform someone, the ""war prisoners"" could've easily been political prisoners transformed into ""Mongoloids"" by plastic surgeons. -It would explain why wartime losses can easily turn into victories. -It simply makes a lot more sense than 3 superstates dominating the world (remember Occam's Razor). -It would explain why there are no Americans, Brazilians, South Africans, or really any non-Brits seen during the book (if Oceania really is that big. you'd expect to see Oceanians from other countries.

So then I began to think: what specific games have a often quoted consensus on optimal count, that you disagree with? Mine would be **Seasons**. 2 player is by far the most recommended player count. It's a game that is entirely just 2 kinds of drafting and card comboing; neither of which is a mechanic that works best at low player counts (loses options and tension). The card draft you only see two hands, the dice draft you only get 3 dice, and you only have 18 cards to start which isn't nearly enough to make interesting combos. I love 3 player, am willing to play 4, and dislike 2 player Seasons. So what about you?"

After putting in many years of hard work at a successful company, my family member's company is going public. She stands to make a good deal of money off off of her stock options but is currently faced with the question of whether to take the cash or cashless options to exercise. She's asked me for my opinion, and I told her she should talk to a financial planner who can really help her, but I'm curious what the community thinks. Is there anyone here who's experienced with stock options and can give an opinion? Here is a basic summary: Cash buy option: Outlay a significant amount of cash to exercise all options. Get to keep all options but have to pay for them and pay resulting tax bill (would require taking out a mortgage against a currently paid-off condo). Cashless option: give up ~30% of options to be able to exercise the rest without having to outlay any initial cash for exercise price and taxes. It seems to me that option one is basically higher risk/higher reward and the ""right"" answer will be something that only time will tell. Let's say you believe there will be a positive outlook for the company. What would you do? Would you take the risk or would you mitigate by going cashless?"

The statement is completely true. It's fucking obvious. Trump didn't go on to say that businesses should be allowed to fire and replace pregnant women. He didn't advocate for doing away with maternity/paternity leave. He noted that from the perspective of the business that suffers reduced productivity it's damned inconvenient.

0,Americans didn't invent the internet,FrJemimaRacktoole,"And then fuck your waifu pillow made in China after arguing with an American on an American message board on an American invented internet, probably even typing on a chinese manufactured computer (or it could be a hodge-podge of internationally manufactured parts, gotta love the global village) in the language native to England but made the lingua franca (FUN FACT! The term was coined in the middle ages when French was in vogue as the international diplomatic language of Europe!) by American media and culture. Not to mention the fact that Black Sabbath was heavily influenced by blues-rock, which maybe the Rolling Stones helped popularize (the rock aspect, at least) but they themselves were influenced by blues musicians and where did the blues come from? Black American music, which influenced international rock and roll icons (from America, of course) like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and so on. Look m8e, America has had a profound effect on the course of world history since its inception. We were the reason the French thought revolution could work, we were the reason Britain was able to galvanize its Empire by learning from their mistakes from us, american inventions propelled the world into the 20th and 21st centuries, we have been a refugee haven for immigrants fleeing war-torn and famine-stricken countries across the world for centuries, we literally bankrupted the Soviet Union with an arms race and had an old-ass actor-become-politician stare down the Berlin wall and reunite that country so that children born afterwards could talk shit about us on the global information network invented for our internal government communications, and guess what? We landed on the fucking moon FIRST. WE did it. US. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. That big fucking rock in the sky, and it was US, because fuck anyone else. If some country attacks you, if a natural disaster fucks you over, who is going to come asking if you need help? WE ARE. And all over the world we are shit on for it, because nobody wants us poking in their business but everyone loves to take our help. Keep talking shit, but we're the reason Europe isn't converting en mass to radical islam right now. My country isn't perfect by any stretch, it has issues right now, but it's able to handle those AND keep helping everyone else out. AMERICA."

0,I thought the key point of nightingale is not so much the absence of carparks but the financial structures... Like you have to buy the apartment long before it's built and then you also can't sell it?,TomasTTEngin,"I think carpark-free property development should be hugely encourage by government. It reduces the cost of development, but because not having a car space is so undesirable for so many people, those savings will probably be largely passed on to the people buying the apartments due to how uncompetitive they are. Not only that, but it rewards people who, either by choice or by necessity, live car free. It also encourages walking and public transport use which improve the vibrancy of an area and help truly local business. In NYC, there are very few large supermarkets, instead there are many small ""convenience stores"", butchers, deli's, etc. Because people dont drive, they buy local and walkable. The only real concerns for this kind of development are: a) that it will clog up local streetside parking with residents who refuse to live car free. This is easily fixed by creating parking restrictions that limit the feasibility of this kind of parking in *most* local spaces. b) it creates limitations of accessibility for people with disabilities who cannot walk great distances. This is fixed by only encouraging this kind of development near accessible public transport lines, and by ensuring that this kind of development is not *universal* in any given area. Car-free apartments need only take up a certain percentage of the market to have a huge positive effect."

He wanted ""Roots Rock Reggae"" on the inside of his bicep. I put the stencil on, I approve it. He looks at the stencil, he approves it. So we start the tattoo. We get ALLLLLL the way to finishing the tattoo before I realized that I spelled ""reggae"" like ""raggae"" and then proceeded to have a mini-heart attack. I set my machine down and looked at the kid. ""We fucked up dude"" ""What do you mean?"" The kid says. I show him the correct spelling of Reggae on my phone and he starts flippin' the fuck out and demands his money back. I told him it was kind of both of our faults, I didn't even want to take this tattoo after closing time, so I'm not giving his money back. He freaked out for a little longer and when he calmed down I told him I'll give him a free cover up. TL;DR Misspelled Reggae on a dudes arm and then offered him a free cover up."

SE is like a doctor that administer the chemotherapy. Done wrongly and you kill the cancer cells AND the good cells. I would say it is very technical challenging to kill all the cancer cells (cheaters) without killing a single good cell (legit player). Either way, someone will get burnt. I had seen games where the ban wave ban cheaters and legit players. It would be fair to give SE Global management team more time to come up with a win-win solutions for us. Some solutions for Battle Tower rewards will be like: * Kill 50 boss to receive 1 summon ticket; kill 100 boss to receive 50 ability ticket; kill 125 boss to receive Heartful egg * Top 500 get Heartful egg; for Rank 501-100,000, those rank ending with 8 also get Heartful egg, e.g.; 508, 518, 528, 1008, 2008 also get Heartful egg. This helps those that just join the game to have access to the rewards too * Removed Heartful Egg from the reward and put Heartful Egg into the chest that we get for every 5 levels. That mean if you kill the 55th Boss, instead of getting 1 ability ticket, you have a chance to get Heartful Egg. Once you got Heartful Egg, you will always get 1 ability ticket. I hope SE do implements one of these solution to help newcomers and experienced players level the playing fields with cheaters. If cheaters can create new accounts and kill 100 boss in 1 day, ban wave is not going to solve anything. What SE can do is to make it less motivating for cheaters to cheat. That is why a lot of store like 7/11 have less than $100 in the store after dark."

0,Well your first problem was not using memory of felwinter,Mgarmsiri2,"Despite the oohing and aahing, Memory of Radegast sucks, and here's why... We've all seen the youtube videos of some folks geeking out and having fun bouncing back any kind of attack they can think of. However, the Memory of Radegast actually is terribly implemented and.. it frankly sucks. I'll stop short of saying it blows, but it's so not worth using. . First, it gives you a bit of extra sword ammo, okay. Not important because of the following problem(s). . It sucks for one reason: Whatever it bounces back takes exponentially more from your ammo than it actually does in damage to any targets. I took it on the Dread to patrol and test out. I tried it on a number of things. Here are the problems with using it: . Taking any kind of damage at all will instantly drain your ENTIRE stock of ammo reserves. I went from 70 sword ammo to zero sword ammo in about 1/2 a second by taking an ogre eye blast. I didn't even bounce it back and do any damage. I just lost all my heavy in the blink of an eye. The level of damage I took to drain that entire sword ammo capacity was miniscule considering I could stand there in full gaze of the ogre's beam without doing anything for at least 5-10 seconds without worry of death, but the sword breaks instantly. . I tried using it against centurions up where they spawn from the drop ships. 5 centurions hitting me all at the same time only bounced back a small amount of damage, half of which missed its target the other half of which barely tickled the captain's shields (he had about 80% shields left) before my sword broke from lack of ammo That lasted all of 2 to 2.5 seconds on several different tries. . The ONLY mobs that this ""bounce back incoming damage"" perk even worked was for the lowest level hive horde. You know, the ones you can melee in 1 hit and stand there ignoring most of the time? Even then the only reason the sword didn't break right away was because their incoming damage was so low that what bounced back didn't even amount to 10% of their health bars. This STILL rapidly drained the sword while I stood there experimenting because holding ""block"" on your sword drains ridiculously fast. While it was in no risk of ""breaking"" the sword due to excessive incoming damage, it was a waste of time because it would never come close to a fart in the wind compared to ONE single bullet of whatever primary you used. . What about crucible, you might ask? You only get so much ammo per heavy brick in crucible. You have to block with the sword to bounce back. You'll get only a few seconds of blocking to use before you're out. You would have to be omniscient to know exactly when to block and when to already have your heavy out, and even then ANY kind of attack you bounce back would be your only attack. You'd be out of ammo after that. Assuming the Deus ex Machina kicked in and you miraculously perfectly blocked at the right time, also accounting for the significant network lag lately, you just aren't going to get anything done with the ""reflect"" perk. . **TL&amp;DR**: Any minor incoming damage drains your entire stock of heavy ammo with NOTHING to show for it. It's utterly worthless in PvE, and almost entirely useless in PvE outside of pre-scripted and pre-coordinated stunts. The only thing it does is up your sword ammo count at the expense of making your sword ammo go away instantly every time you use it."

I live in Denver and the only voter contact we've had was a canvasser from the Bernie Sander's campaign. I see very few voter signs in people's yards, only a few more campaign bumper stickers on the freeway. For contrast, in 2012 I saw far more Romney stickers driving around than I've seen Clinton ones this year. The only presidential sign I've seen within three blocks of my house was a Trump sign, and I live in a primarily working class Hispanic/Asian neighborhood with a notable Muslim minority demographic. This area should be Disneyland for Hillary Clinton. My wife is a registered Democrat who caucused for Bernie Sanders, but no one from the campaign has contacted her to ask who she plans to vote for (Hillary of course, but wouldn't they want to at least cross her name off a list?) By contrast, we'd had many contacts by the Obama campaign in both their '08 and '12 iterations by this point in the cycle. Obama signs and bumper stickers were ubiquitous, as were McCain and Romney ones. I can only see two possibilities here. Either Clinton believes Colorado is already in the bag for her and is spending resources elsewhere or...her ground game is only considered ""great"" because her opponent's is non-existent. I guess we'll find out on Tuesday, but this is going to be a much tighter win for Hillary than she expected."

When the game plays smooth it's probably one of my favorite CoDs. I am really enjoying it and can see myself playing for a while. However, I'm genuinely concerned the playerbase on this game is going to be very low. It's already very low in sales compared to previous CoD's. Combine that with the online connection issues and I fear it will become a ghost town. I'm already finding longer than average waits for certain gamemodes like FFA, where in other games there's never a wait. Even this subreddit is fairly low and not that active. The game was certainly not as well received as previous CoD's and I can see it just completely falling off in a few months."

0,This brawl is a rage-fest from experience,OriginalName123123,"2 wins vs 15 losses! This tavern brawl was supposed to be fun, but OMFG.... Typically what happens is; Opponent plays a minion on a board with 2 of my minions and 1 of his. It triggers the Blessing of Kings on his minion. My turn. Play a minion, it triggers (true story) Blessing of Kings. On his minion! I am not the greatest Hearthstone player. But this tavern brawl is 90% RNG. My RNG is insane, for some reason, my minions ALWAYS selfdestruct as soon as they hit the board. From the 2 games 1, the second was only because my opponent left even though he was winning. The first was a win where I actually had a decent amount of luck. Probably a little more then my opponent. That is 1 game in 17 games where luck was in my favor. If I would get a dollar for every time a random damage spell killed my own minions... I would have somewhere around 350 dollar."

As some of us hide skeletons in our closets, Donald proudly displays his on the lawn: see what he has made. In this way he is worse than an actual bigot. A genuinely awful person still has some central beliefs, but what sits in the empty center of Donald Trump is opportunism stripped of cleverness or cause-- just an ugly desire to exploit."

I was already on the phone with the 22nd precinct in NYC before the phones stopped broadcasting. Rickey btw is going to be fine. He did hit his head/jaw on the pavement. No concussion.

For clothing I am looking for something waterproof that breathes cause I like to get my cardio in while I bike. I rarely do the leisurely ride. Any recommendations on pants, and jackets would be awesome. Also curious about warmth, as it gets colder I am not sure the super breathable rain gear will be up to the task. Next is socks. Is there a trick to keeping my socks dry or do winter commuters always just take a spare pair in to work? Lastly glasses in the rain.

0,I try to be just as nice myself.,Gek_Lhar,"I am confused... How can someone be THIS nice? Hello there, This evening I just casually played some Rocket League online matches (like i do almost every evening) as I got matchmaked with this random dude. He was really nice in-game and I asked him if he wants to trade. When we started trading, I didn't find anything I was interested in and he wasn't interested in anything from me either. He had heatwave though, and I asked him if he wanted to trade it. He declined, but said if he got another one he would give it to me (I wasn't really believing him, because why would someone do this? :D)! After that we played some matches together and I mentioned that I need to gather keys to buy Slipstream! He replied to this, that he gave one as a gift to a friend, and then proceeded to ask me if I wanted it. I said yes, and asked how much he wants for it. He said: Nothing! At this point I thought he was just trolling... After the match ended we left the lobby, and he went to collect the Slipstream from his friend! He then proceeded to play some games with him, and as it took a while I thought to myself: ""Well, this is it I guess. Why did I even expect him to give it to me?"" Oh boy, I never thought I could be this wrong... I asked him if he's still up to it, and agreed! He invited me, we traded with each other, and - long story short - gave me the Slipstream. For free. I said to him: ""Wow, Of course I can give you keys for it, they will unlock on sunday!"", but he just said: ""Don't worry. it's yours now :)"". I was baffled... I had the Slipstream. He didn't want anything in return. He even gave me another painted topper and dark matter for free... What is going on here? The only thing he wanted to accept though, were lessons in freestyling, which we then proceeded to do! I don't know what else to say other than to thank him :) I am sure he won't see this, and I don't want to mention his name here, but I still want to show you guys, that there are still some really kind people out there! :)"

You nerf the heroes that are always picked, and buff the heroes which are never picked. Using anything else as a basis for what is overpowered versus what isn't is nonsensical. The legitimate argument for not nerfing lucio or reinhardt too much is that you want them overpowered on purpose; overpowered by design. This is also featured in dota - there are several items which are designed to be overpowered and provide you with far more than your money's worth - bkb and blink dagger are the obvious ones, but there are others as well."

0,"The Knight of Space: ""Fuck you I don't want to make the frog""",Archliewhite,"I wanna try a minimal session here. I'd go with a Knight of Time and Knight of Space, and that's it. Why Knight? Unlike, say, Page or Prince, it doesn't seem to come with drawbacks. The player just becomes stronger using their aspect. From what I remember, Dave began manipulating time earlier and more precisely than John did with wind; sure, he made items to do it, but how exactly the aspect is used is not too relevant. Or, if we interpret Knight as a ""protector"" role, then that's still not too bad, protecting Space and Time is what keeps you out of doomed timelines and gets the game finished. Now, if this pair has flaws, it's that they don't have a strong leader figure to command them. We've already seen that Dave didn't want to lead at all, and neither did any Space player. These might be more personal traits, but I think Skaia picks your classpect based on your personality to some extent. Still, with only two players, things like lack of communication are less of an issue than with 4 or 12. As long as they survive entry and the first stage of building, the first one could get through their gate and then they could just continue doing the session together. Given that a 2 player session can exist at all, it should be possible to beat it, and working together they might just be able to pull it off. That does leave the self-realization piece of their quest, since the knights we've seen seem to have some deep-seated issues... But then again, Karkat and Dave developed the most by being together. Not sure if this is the Blood aspect doing magic or maybe just their personalities matching well after initial friction, but the shared classes could also play a role. So hopefully the same would happen for my heroes Dave and Galacta Knight. Also this way I can call the space player Galacta Knight and not be wrong..."

0,Have you played the Borderlands series?,FatalDosesOfOsmosis,"Looking for a PC FPS game. These are my preferences. I'm a very casual gamer, in terms of hours played. About once a year I try to read up on new games to find something that'll get me hooked, which often ends in disappointment. Here's the thing: I hate story. Every time I have to sit through a cutscene I want to blow my head off. I hate having to learn complex and/or forced systems just to be able to enjoy the game. It's not that I think it's impossible to create a video game with a great story, I've just never seen it. To give you some examples of what I *do* like, I love the gameplay of Half-Life 2, but the story is fucking atrocious. I enjoy COD4, but it's too linear/constrained. I've had a lot of fun with Just Cause 3, but liberating city after city in a very similar way gets a bit tired. Far Cry 3 is pretty close to what I'm looking for, but there's too much arbitrary, ridiculous stuff to learn. It feels constructed. I want something more down-to-earth. I just want to be walking around by myself, exploring a jungle, abandoned city or whatever, finding weapons, every now and then encountering someone who tries to kill me, and figuring out smart ways to take them out. Sneaking up on them, sniping from a distance, hiding in the shadows, stuff like that. Did I mention I hate crowded, chaotic battlefields? Console is not an option. I can't stand using a controller to look around. It feels like I'm trying to get out of a swamp with my arms and legs cut off. I'd be grateful for any relevant suggestions. Thanks! :)"

0,"Steelers is probably the most winnable, wouldnt be surprised if we ended the season 8-8, doesnt mean I wont be livid though",Jakethejoker,"How do you see these next 5 games panning out for the Giants? Earlier in the year, I made a prediction that after the bye week, the worst we could go is 5-4. So far, my prediction is still holding true, with the G-Men going 4-0. (5 games left, I think we will win at the very least 1 of the divisional games) Now that we beat the winless Browns, it's time to get serious with our expectations. We've seen the Steelers, with their fearful offense of Big Ben, Antonio Brown, and Le'veon Bell, play flat out awful at times..and other times just destroy the other team. Matthew Stafford has been playing surprisingly well this year, playing probably as a top 7 QB, and being able to close out games when they matter. Dallas is the team to beat right now, and they are just running red hot on all cylinders. The Redskins found their stride as well, I think Kirk Cousins will finish out this season somewhere in as a top 10 QB for this year. The Eagles I think are the weakest of the remaining, but we definitely know they can show up on any given day. Now as I stated, realistically (and the pessimistic side), I think the worst we can go in these next 5 games is 1-4. If I were to play a bit more optimistic but stay real, my gut somehow tells me we can only finish at 3-2 (wins possibly against the Lions or Steelers, and probably 2 of the 3 remaining division rivals). Our defense is solid, but this is now the test for our offense and see if they can finally start clicking. What do you guys think? 5-0, 4-1, 3-2, 2-3, 1-4, 0-5?"

Some of these things on the list are NOT ""all of a sudden,"" but have been going on for several years already. Some would have been unbelievable a few years ago. May God help us and have mercy. Think, all of this in less than eight years. Before Obama, there was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America. All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools. All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses. All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons. All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture. All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them. All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law. All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in ""anti-Muslim speech"" All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declare they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like ""workplace violence."" All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. All of a sudden out troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS. All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted. All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs. All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war, and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers. All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I ; levels of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress. All of a sudden half of out aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East. All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility. All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer. All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans hungry Americans, or displaced Americans, but there is endless money for Obama's ""Syrian refugee"" resettlement programs. All of a sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA. All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American Citizens. All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian Funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. All of a sudden the President of the United States won't attend the funeral of a flag-ranked Officer (General Greene) killed in action; heplayed golf. But he sends a gig delegation to Michael Brown's funeral. He sends a minor delegation to Margaret Thatcher's funeral. He won't acknowledge Chris Kyle's murder, but he'll fly the Flag at half mast for Whitney Houston. All of a sudden, I'm sick to my stomach. I'm not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much ""progress"" has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime! If you agree, be strong enough to at least forward this to a few friends."

Unfortunately I will be most likely unable to transfer dorms as the school tries to use it as a huge selling point to prospective students that all dorm mates are best friends, so don't really have any spare rooms etc. outside of the different dorms. I'm thinking of just bunking out in another friend's dorm for the rest of the semester. I hate how the first thing I think of when I wake up is this. I'm just thinking back now to all the little signs those 3 dorm mates gave throughout the past few weeks that they disliked me and realized that they've actually bitched about me quite a bit, I've just never processed that they were talking about me 'the annoying one that lives there'. I don't drink and party and do drugs and unfortunately all of them indulge in those activities a lot of days-- there is nothing wrong with that, I just wish they wouldn't hate on me for wanting something different. Another thing that alienates me is that the reason they have so much free time is that they purposely chose easy classes and have no other commitments. I feel so hurt that I have sports, a council position and am taking fucking real analysis as a freshman at one of the most academically difficult colleges and all I get out of it is being hated and ridiculed by my dorm mates. What's the point of working hard and challenging yourself, honestly. I hate this so much. Sorry for the rant I just feel fucking terrible and I have 3 papers, 1 problem set and a analysis response due Monday and I am stressed because I didn't do shit last night because of what I overheard."

She was always the hottest girl at school, the first one to get a ""womanly"" figure, big boobs, hottest boyfriends etc. I was a late bloomer, nerdy girl, completely uninterested in boys until after leaving secondary school, didn't wear makeup etc. She made my life hell throughout school, she'd even get her gang to beat up my friends to stop them being friends with me (didn't work, thankfully, and we are all still close to this day). Anyway for many reasons I moved away from my hometown as soon as I turned 18. Puberty was kind to me and I think I'm pretty decent looking. Put my linguistic abilities to use and I now speak 5 languages fluently. I travel a lot and had lived and worked in 3 different countries by the time I was 20. I have worked as an English teacher in France and Italy, a hotel manager in France, and I moonlight a bit as a jazz singer with a few U.K. Jazz orchestras when I'm around. I don't go to my hometown much but I was back for Christmas and I ran into Katie. She was serving me in the pound shop (uk equivalent of a dollar store), must've weighed about 250 pounds and looked absolutely mortified to see that the nerdy girl she'd sent to hospital on several occasions with her beatings was stood in front of her holding a Prada handbag and waiting for her change from the bottles of pop that she'd just bought. It was hella satisfying and I don't even care if I sound like an insufferable smug bitch. I spent time in hospital because of her and I used to cry every morning and beg my mum not to make me go to school and face her. So glad she got hers."

0,It's not a very common belief and it's just a running gag.,faceroll_it,"Question about one particular Snoke theory Hey guys, I just found this sub, and I gotta say I'm honestly surprised I never looked this up before. Hope you all are doing good. Would love a decent response but if the answer is really simple than that's no problem either. So a common belief is that Mace Windu is Snoke. I've seen this around, but I haven't looked into it too much simply because I don't usually worry about fan theories (regarding *anything* from any show, movie, etc.). Now my first question is pretty simple; is this a legitimate theory or is it just a running gag in the fan base (like how Jar Jar is a sith lord lol)? If it is a joke then oh well. If it's legitimately being considered, can someone explain how this can even be considered valid? For starters, why would Mace Windu, a renowned Jedi master, become evil? He has no reason to. What points to this theory being possible? (As I said, I haven't looked into this too much and I figure this is a great place to ask) Also, I read somewhere that Samuel L. Jackson asked good ol' George if Windu could survive his fall, to which Lucas responded with a yes. I personally want to believe he's alive lol. Thanks for any answers guys."

That's just game theory at work. The same is true here in Canada for any single riding. The idea that anyone but the Republicans and Democrats had any chance is a fairy tale. For anyone to have a chance in the presidential race they'll have to first displace either of those parties. If Trump had fallen apart earlier then maybe there would have been room for another party to rise in their place. Or perhaps Trump could have been the third party candidate if his Republican nomination failed. Either way, this election stood the highest chance of any modern election for having a third party take it. And yet it didn't happen."

I honestly feel this is how Trump operates. After Khan, he became quite remarkably reformed. He takes the lead, does stupid things, and is then able to defer to other people's judgement since his wasn't good. The problem is, the first debate is the most important. Second and third, not so in terms of lulling fence voters. But he can't get any worse, while Clinton has set a rather high standard for herself this time, so who knows."

We've kind of already done the ""easy to swallow"" comic book stories at this point and Hollywood is grasping around tot ry and milk this cow for all it's worth so they're walking into fringe ideas that will only appeal to niche audiences. But they're trying to throw mass market budgets at it and are trying to shoehorn in these ideas that I think were designed to attempt to make a silly concept easier to swallow. Hence Suicide Squad. It's a pity too. It could have been a good movie for the right audience. But because of tremendous Hollywood greed it was a movie designed for everyone that appealed to no one. Until the industry gets out of this mindset that EVERY movie must be a summer blockbuster we'll have more and more of this ridiculousness."

It's a legendary dagger which constantly tries to kill you if you don't have a special gauntlet equipped (which the runner doesn't, since you need to complete all main quests to get it and who has time for quests in a speedrun?). But Keening also provides stat bonuses while it's equipped, and a bug in Morrowind lets you stack those bonuses if you swap to and from that weapon fast enough. So for the next two minutes, he constantly swaps to stack more and more speed, allowing him to go through every wall he wants, collect Sunder (the other weapon needed to kill the boss), go to the end of the game and destroy the heart of Lorkhan, completing the final main quest."

My mother is typically very sweet natured, helpful, and respectful. She is also, however, extremely old fashioned and assigns gender roles whenever applicable. She is very religious as well. We immigrated from a former Soviet country, and my mom definitely has some leftover baggage...there...somewhere... I recently went back to work after my maternity leave. My spouse is a wonderful man and usually chills with baby while I work (He works a few days, mostly my days off. I bring home most of our income.) Our work schedules overlap on one day and that is when baby hangs with grandma. A few days ago was this overlap day. I called mom halfway through my shift to check in, everything is cool. Then work blew up and I stayed an hour later than expected. When I got to my mother's house, she was rocking baby back and forth in a stroller. My baby was crying. She said he had been that way for the past hour. She then told me she was ""sick of this"" and ""cannot go on like this""...??? She said she wasn't going to watch him next time. Ok so she is stressed, I understand. Then she drops this gem: ""You're barely raising your own children! Why are you having kids just to pass them off to someone else?"" That HURT. I didnt say a word. I work 30 hours a week and my man works even less than that. We work out our schedules and budgets to spend as much time as possible together as a family. One of our priorities is for our little ones to spend time with one parent while the other is at work rather than go to a day care. But nevermind all of that, I'm clearly bad mom for working to support my family. I have not spoken to her since, about 5 days. 3 days in she sent me a few nasty texts about hurting her because we all went trick or treating together. Again, she is super religous, but usually respectful and wouldn't go out of her way to send me texts about how I hurt HER by ""leaving God"" and allowing my kids to be kids on Halloween. I didn't reply again. I have since changed my schedule and will not be working that overlap day. I don't want to rely on someone who will guilt trip me and get weird. Sorry, just needed to vent."

That would be a total of 56,552 minutes, or 942 hours, including the original Bee Movie. There are a total of 49,581 vowels in the Shrek saga. (yes, I used ctrl+F on each script for each vowel) The Godfather trilogy is 539 minutes, and playing it for every vowel for one run of the Shrek saga would take 26,724,159 minutes, so applying it to all 153 of the Shrek sagas would be 4,088,852,974 minutes, or 68,147,549 hours including the original Bee Movie play and the Shrek sagas. There are 81,894 words in the Godfather Trilogy, so playing the Nutshack theme every tenth word would mean 8,189 Nutshack themes per Godfather trilogy, of which there are 7,585,893. The Nutshack theme is about one minute, so the total time so far including the original Bee Movie, the 153 Shrek sagas and the 7,585,893 Godfather trilogies and Nutshack themes is 66,209,730,751 minutes, or 1,103,495,512 hours. The Nutshack theme says ""nutshack"" 16 times, meaning nutshack is said a total of 993,934,044,432 times. The Bee Movie is played each of these times, coming to a grand total of 94,489,943,951,791 minutes, 1574,832,399,196 hours, 64,618,016,633 days, or 179,175,388 years.

0,Thanks mate,Bigmethod,"my guild did heroic xavius last night and heroic cenarius a few nights ago. we had more trouble with heroic cenarius but i think it might just be because of the strat we were initially using. we found things a lot easier when we kept ranged in the center away from the melee stack, and just moved the boss along with the melee to whatever you want to purify. clearing brambles with rogues/hunters is also pretty mandatory. we didn't ever break malfurion out, and just made sure to stack tank/external cooldowns on whoever is getting speared so the shit on the floor didn't spread. once you can reliably make it to phase 2, it really isn't that bad. i don't think we've wiped in phase 2 on either of our kills. heroic xavius was pretty much the same as normal, you just need your healers/other dispellers to be really coordinated on corruption, because people will eventually start getting mc'd near the end of the fight. besides that it wasn't really that difficult, at least from the perspective of a melee dps. pretty tank/healer intensive though. good luck homie"

You are in a popular barber shop in Berlin. 6 other men and 3 women, friends or wives of the men, are in the barber shop with you. The radio is playing wonderful music by Wilhelm Bach. Everybody is enjoying the music. A radio announcer interrupts the music program and says he has an important announcement for all Germans and Germany. Several nice German people crowd around the radio with you to hear the important announcement. Millions of Germans across Germany are crowding around their radios, too. The radio announcer says, in German, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, today the National Socialist German Worker's Party has just released a statement that it has appointed Adolf Hitler as the new Chancellor of Germany."" Everybody in the barber shop smiles. Everybody likes the news. They are all thinking the same thing, ""Hitler. A great man. Our Chancellor. He will make Germany great again."" A man standing next to you, Heinz, asks you, ""What kind of Chancellor do you think Hitler will be? You look straight into Heinz's eyes and answer, ""6 years from now he will start World War Two. The war will last 6 years. The war will kill more than 70 million people around the world. Beginning today, during the next 12 years, Hitler will order the execution of more than 11 million Jews and other minorities in Germany, Poland, and other countries that border Germany. Hitler's Nazi Party will murder most of those 11 million victims in concentration camps."" Heinz looks at you like you are crazy and says, ""You are out of your mind. Hitler is a great man. We all love him. He will be a great Chancellor. He will make the Fatherland great again. Get out of here. We don't want to ever see or hear you again. Don't ever come back to this barber shop!""

0,A wasted vote is a wasted vote,vDukie,"A few reasons. I think both Hillary and Donnie are disasters. She is corrupt and he is crazy. Vermont is one of the few States where Bernie could actually rise above the political event horizon based solely on write in votes. He is extraordinarily popular here, mostly because we know him well. In the most recent credible poll of Vermont, it was 45% Hillary, 17% Trump, 4% Johnson, 2% Stein... and 4% Bernie, even though he is not on the ballot. That's pretty amazing. I much prefer voting for someone I support, rather than holding my nose and going for the lesser of two evils. The ""lesser"" strategy just guarantees we end up with evil. No, thank you.

""5.56 is cheaper and we're only putting holes in paper at 25 yards,"" they said. ""But it doesn't matter because we're having fun anyway! Want to shoot with us?"" How. Dare. They. We all know SCARs are basically free if you build them with secondhand parts and mail in rebates, and you literally just steal ammo because once you shoot it, it's gone forever anyway. If anything, ammo companies should pay me for testing their product. Plus my 7.62x51 is a bigger round and therefore objectively better at putting holes in paper at 25 yards. I tried forcing them to acknowledge my superior product and validate my purchase by getting their own but, get this, they said they were happy with their own decisions and were considering getting ANOTHER AR so they wouldn't have to share.

0,Always appreciate this meme,Lulamoon,"Here's the thing. You said a ""perfect sphere is a spheroid conglomeration."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies spheroid conglomerations, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls perfect spheres spheroid conglomerations. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""spheroid conglomeration family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of spheroids, which includes things from ellipsoids to oblates to prolates. So your reasoning for calling a perfect sphere a spheroid conglomeration is because random people ""call the round ones spheroid conglomerations?"" Let's get cubes and pyramids in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A perfect sphere is a perfect sphere and a member of the spheroid conglomeration family. But that's not what you said. You said a perfect sphere is a spheroid conglomeration, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the spheroid conglomeration family spheroid conglomerations, which means you'd call ellipsoids, oblates, and other prolates spheroid conglomerations, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Tell her through a loudspeaker that if she doesn't speak all of her immediate interests and passions into the microphone within 20 seconds, the tarantula hawks will swarm on her harder than cazedors on fallout new vegas. When she's finished, gas the entire room and let her go. If all goes well, she still has no idea who you are, and you know exactly what to talk to her about! Problem solved! It's foolproof! If any of the tarantula hawks sting her, great. That's just another funny story that she can tell you and your future children about.

0,"Shotguns are a little weak in IW, so my vote for weapon balance goes to BO3, which every weapon in that game was good at something.",gLore_1337,Infinite warfare is pretty balanced. Smgs can only kill fast from like 5-10 yards max. Assault rifles shoot slower (of course) but do more damage at close and medium to long range. Lmgs and snipers melt at long ranges. People can hate all they want on IW but it's the best Cod since bo2 for sure. And before bo2 then mw2 imo. Has great hit detection like ghost did and all the guns are balanced (some guns are pretty cool where you can switch between smg and AR so it's like a hybrid and can be used in various situations.

Three of the hats are black and two of the hats are white. Blindfolds are then placed over each man's eyes and a hat is placed on each man's head. The two hats left over are hidden. The blindfolds are then removed and it is said to the men that if one of them can guess what color hat he is wearing they can all leave unharmed. The man in the rear who can see both of his friends' hats but not his own says, ""I don't know"". The middle man who can see the hat of the man in front, but not his own says, ""I don't know"".

0,Watch Jojo,Joseph-Joestar,"Coming back to anime a decade later In my college years, I was quite obsessed with anime, to the point where I ended up taking two years of Japanese. My college had a great anime club that showed a wide variety. I worked a campus job and spent most of the little I earned on monthly DVD orders. My shelves were full of anime, more than I could even watch. After graduating in 2005, I started to lose interest. I didn't have anyone to talk about it with. I had no idea what the latest great show was. I had access to more forms of entertainment that took up more and more of my time. I basically spent an entire year playing WoW. Fast forward to now. I start to see anime becoming more and more available on services like Hulu. I discover Crunchyroll. I start to peek at how the American anime scene has changed in 10 years... and I am astounded. The sheer amount is incredible. You can watch things right when they air in Japan. What I would have given to have this kind of availability - I wouldn't have needed to buy so many DVDs! But at the same time... how the heck do you make up for missing a decade of content? And how I have changed too. I used to be an absolute sub purist. Now I prefer dubs so I don't have to constantly read. My girlfriend has no interest in it, so I mainly watch on the computer or when she's gone. I wonder if I can find some things she will like. Anyway, just felt like sharing this. I thought I might have ""outgrown"" anime but I don't that you can. Right now I'm watching Steins;Gate and really loving it. Not sure what's next. I'll probably watch Eva again to bring me back to the start of my fandom. So here's to rediscovering something you thought you'd lost."

The ones that didn't get captured or poisoned quickly put aside their differences one night, and convened a meeting. ""Sons of bitches, and bitches,"" an elderly mongrel said, standing on top of a dust bin. He had one eye, and his fur was mangy and crawling with mites. He had survived many fights, and sired at least ten thousand pups.""We have reached a dangerous point in our existence."" Around him other dogs listened with rapt attention, their tongues hanging out. Some licked their balls, one of the few luxuries left in this cruel world that had suddenly decided to turn against them. ""At this rate, and per my calculations..."" he turned to another stray who jumped up and whispered into his ear, ""...we will all be exterminated within 22 days."" There was a collective gasp. A dog began to howl, and a chappal came flying from a window. ""Shoo!"" a man's gruff voice followed it. ""Hut!"" ""Silence, comrades,"" the old dog said. ""We are not welcome amongst humans anymore."" ""But we are their best friend,"" a bitch said. Her name was Rani, and she as a total bitch. Everyone knew that. When the mating season came, Rani was the first to go into heat, and had up to 4 dogs banging her at one time. While other bitches mated out of instinct, Rani mated for pleasure. She was barren, and had never given birth to a litter, and that made her more attractive for the boys who didn't want the responsibility of starting a family at a young age. She continued. ""We were there before they discovered fire. How can they kill us now?"" The old mongrel atop the dust bin shook his head in sadness. ""I know. I know. But we have lost control in their cities. With food everywhere, we had no worries, and then we focused our attention on stupid territorial games. We fought a great many battles, and... ""The Kutta Sutras were written in the golden age of 1990s,"" a young dachshund said. ""All my ancestors fought and died in the wars. Are you saying it's for nothing?"" He started slowly wagging his tail. A few other dogs stood up. The old mongrel barked once. His eye gleamed red as an oncoming car's lights struck it. ""Sit down, bitches. If you want to survive beyond next week, hear me out. This is what we must do."" All the dogs sat down obediently, for they were good boys."

The site was also integrated with a companion blog site, for instance on the homepage of the website it showed the 3 latest blog posts. As these blog posts had images that were hosted on a different domain, that domain also had to support HTTPS or we would get a mixed content warning. The blog site was built in WordPress, and WordPress commonly uses absolute URLs in the database. To make things worse, WordPress uses PHP serialized strings, which means if you do a simple find/replace in the database it will cause large amounts of data to be lost. Writing a script to perform this replacement safely took some time. Also, 2 days after the migration I got an angry phone call from one of our departments saying that their customer support portal was down. This Lotus Domino app was hosted on a different server, but unbeknownst to me they had installed some obscure Lotus Domino Reverse Proxy IIS plugin on our prod webserver (long before my time) which freaked out whenever URL Rewrite rules were applied to it. This took a further week to fix, because we had to bring in an ex-employee who was the only person that understood how any of this stuff worked.

Everyone enjoy the holiday? We all good? Because I recalled a doozy of a tale that shot my blood pressure up. We have an item that rings up per pound. This item is usually over $35 and takes 10-10+ minutes to make. As you can during a rush, this is very inconvenient. So of course, our most inconvenient item is on sale! For let's say for anonymous sake, $2 per pound. Customers don't like to read or can't, we all know that. So they see $2 **per pound** and only pay attention to the $2. Which pisses them off most of the time when they realize the item is $30ish on sale. But one customer decided to scream at the register. They said they spoke to one of us who said that they could have it for $2. And the store manager overrid the item, our long to make expensive ass item for only $2. So our department manager comes and speaks to us all. No one spoke to this customer. Doesn't end there. The store manager brings the cashier to us who is IN TEARS and asks if we spoke to the customer. Our kickass protective department manager says he spoke to us and we didn't. And NONE of us are dumb enough to ever give ""permission"" for something like that, even if we could we'd get our manager! So store manager asks who said the customer could have the item for $2 then. THE CUSTOMER LIED, DUH. He and the pissed off department manager (because wow that was the dumbest thing SM ever did) start yelling/discussing the issue while my coworker and I gave the poor cashier food to enjoy. We never did learn why he brought crying cashier back with him."

Many child molesters harm children for reasons other than sexual attraction, while many pedophiles (such as myself) recognize that sexual activity with children is harmful and wrong and choose to abstain. As for your question, pedophiles do have sexual preferences like teliophiles (people attracted to people their own age). Some are attracted to boys, girls, or both, and some prefer certain ages more than others. Some are also exclusive in that they are only attracted to children while others (once again, like myself) are also attracted to adults, although usually the attraction to adults is weaker than the attraction to children. Finally, yes, pedophiles tend to find certain characteristics more attractive than others. I tend to prefer blondes and blue eyes and pig-tails. Personality-wise, I like kids who are feisty and tough, although I like that in adults too."

0,Lol I guess I am not sleeping tonight,IIllllI,"Nail polish, the broken lock, and the time it wasn't me First post so I apologize in advance if the formatting is wrong, I'm on mobile. I have 3 short incidents to share and since they're so short I figured I'd put them all together. I have had a very glitchy life so I'm happy to have found this place. First incident is the nail polish. When I was about 13 or 14 lived in a house where weird things happened all the time but this was the weirdest. I was sitting in my room on the floor with my back against the wall reading. My book was in my lap so I was leaning over, there were no windows behind me and I was facing the door. Out of nowhere I felt something smack me straight in the back of the head, it felt like someone threw it at me. I reached behind me and found nail polish that I didn't own was what hit me. To be clear it didn't hit me on the top of the head, it hit me in the center of the back of my head which was facing the wall. Never been able to explain that one. The broken lock, this one happened earlier this week. The house I'm in now I've lived in for 2 1/2 years and within the first month of moving in I managed to break the lock on our bathroom door. It was around 3 in the morning when I got up to use the bathroom, I wasn't asleep and had yet to go to bed. So when I go to leave the bathroom door has locked from the inside. I turned the lock back and forth a few times and the door knob still wouldn't move. I just stood there for at least 3 minutes turning the lock until the door opened. I told my girlfriend what happened and since then I don't think the bathroom door has been shut. The time it wasn't me. This takes place when I was 16, in a different but still weird house than the nail polish story. I was home alone with my mom one afternoon when I heard her talking to someone in the hallway out side of my room. I thought she was talking to the dogs at first but the more I listened the more it sounded like a conversation. Me being an antisocial teenager I cracked my door open to see if someone came over. Instead I saw my mom in the hallway talking to me. I froze for a second and my mom turned her back to do something, then I opened my door and asked my mom who she was talking to. She turned around and asked me how I got to my room so quickly. When I told her I have been in my room all afternoon she just shrugged it off as ""Oh that's weird"" and never spoke of it again. I've got more stories I'll post later on, they're longer so they'll get their own posts. I'm cool with any theories you guys have, especially about the nail polish because that still fucks me up sometimes."

0,"I think a realtor adding a ""special clause"" to a contract just might be construed at practicing law without a license.",jmd_forest,"Realtors add ""special clauses"" to a contract? I don't think so - unless you're talking about the clause that makes it very hard for the buyer to sue their realtor. The buyer &amp; seller go to mediation, while the realtors must be sued separately. The realtor's contract protects the realtor first, not the buyer. Home insurance companies do not spend ""days and thousands"" on each policy. These policies are easy to buy, and easy to replace. If all of your examples barely apply to any normal situation, it's hard to see how your examples are very relevant. And finally the realtor conjures $20,000 out of thin air... ""gets the seller to pay for it."" No, more like the price of the house is lowered and the buyer sees by how much. And what agent recommends the house sale be delayed for repairs? The buyer who is ignorant of the cost is in trouble, because most repairs happen after the house has changed hands - not before."

He keeps trying to buy me food during football games and band competitions, and he's told me that he intends on doing so during the basketball season as well. He also came up with nicknames for me, and keeps trying to get me to make up one for him, too. I'm in the higher-average of the middle class, and he keeps calling me ""rich girl."" He's always super passive aggressive and constantly tries to find excuses or stuff to do with me. He tried to invite himself over to my house, and come up with his own weekly schedule for three hours!

I chose to save Arcadia Bay instead of saving Chloe, so all those reversing didn't matter anymore in the end, it is as if she never could reverse time in the first place.

0,"It's the most advanced ""assistant"" by a country mile by auto companies...",lipper2000,"100% OK. We have Teslas as poolcars. Teslas 'autopilot"" has - like the others to - a massiv issue with construction zones at the autobahn. It just dosn't recognizes the yellow stripes that mark the new way and trys to follow the old, whites. It also has issues with complex overlapings of lanes that sometimes can happen and then tends to go ""straight"" even if your real lane takes a slight curve. Next thing... the autopilot is to slow for the autobahn. If you drive over 160km+ on the left lane, its reacts way to late to cars that swap over the left for a quick pass in the middlelane. If it reacts, it reacts hard. I guess its about the range of the radar? Overall, I never use the 'autopilot' out of the above reasons. Just in low speed jams it is, like all the other assistants of similar properties, a nice thing. In all the other scenarios its sadly, a headache. So, it should be called what it is, like at the other manufacturers. An assistant - not more. But with that, you ain't getting the sweet viral PR in the internet."

0,Is there any chance that the Char clone is Gaelio and Ein in one body?,pocketbadger,"To summarise this episode: ""They are playing Tekkadan like a fucking fiddle!"" * The showdown between Arbrau and the SAU is in Balfour Plain, sparked by an SAU recon plane getting pwned by Ahab Reactors of the ADF's Hloekk Grazes in hiding. The SAU have their noobish defence force, backed up by 'Horn garrisons and even the White Elephant Fleet. Arbrau have their equally noobish defence force, the outmanned Tekkadan, and Mossa's MS team. * This attrition warfare has lasted for two weeks, and the Arbrau forces are feeling the strain. Even Takaki feels something is amiss with this border conflict. Cue OP. * Aston, in a Landman Rodi, watched a fellow pilot get pwned by a Graze, so he went berserk on the assailant. Meanwhile, Lord McGillis observed the battle from afar. His retinue didn't expect the conflict to be so hard-fought and drawn out. But the Genius Elusive Shadow picked up on Arbrau's restrained tactics to deliberately keep a stalemate instead of going all-out and decide the victor right away, especially in using Tekkadan like puppets. * Despite incoming enemy reinforcements, Aston retreated, promisig to retrieve his fallen brother in arms. Meanwhile, an ADF MW became a loose cannon and charged onwards. A Tekkadan MW tried to stop him, only to get thanklessly pwned. * At daybreak, Takaki just bagged up their 12th fallen. Billy Mays walked in to press 'F' for the fallen and offer some rations. He sure gave Takaki and Aston some good figurative petting with the ""You boys did great, despite the situation"" talk and stuff before leaving. All part of the plan... * At camp, the tired boys sighed at how they lost track of time and forgot what the war was for. Takaki unwittingly did Mossa's bidding of holding the carrot on a stick at the boys, telling them to hang in there. Later, he admitted he also felt as lost as the boys. Just then, Takaki received another deployment order from Captain Billy Mays--Wait, **Captain**?! Oh, because Mossa was the one calling the shots and all, huh? OK... * Meanwhile, Gokaiger Yellow was pestering Megaranger Blue who was working on his Gundam equipped with a unique system. She then went on about her Senpai and Rustal-sama before calling Darth Vidar's identity into question. You may share Gaelio's voice for whatever reason, but who are you really? * Meanwhile again, Space Nils gloated about how everything is going to Lord Elion's plan, especially with Lord Fareed steadily losing Prestige and gaining opinion maluses. For Lord Elion, the real MVP is Billy Mays for keeping his plot so fun to track. * En route to the AO, Takaki spaced out about the point of the battle when Aston took point and spotted an SAU blockade. He wastd no time to try and go to town on the enemy. * Even as the Hotarubi drew closer to Earth, Eugene grumbled about the ongoing comms blackout. News feed was all they got to keep posted on the boys on Earth. But Big Boss knows he can rely on his boys on Earth and on the way to Earth to prepare themselves. * While Lafter and Azee watched Guts pump iron, the newbies wondered why the air wasn't so tense despite rushing to Earth. As Kudelia also sighed about the comms blackout, Hush appeared to Mika to report. He has done his Shiden sims, his Shiden tuning, and even his work out. Mika instructed his wingman to rest up while he can, because he probably ain't getting any on arrival. * Eugune then followed up with a rousing speech comparable to Orga's. ""He's just aping Orga,"" Mika remarked, annoying the Deputy Boss. Akihiro hoped his boys would hold on a bit longer. Cue interim. * After school, Fuka visited Chad in Edmonton General Hospital. He's been in a medical nanomachine (son!) for so long, still unconscious. The nurse assured the slower healing process only means he'll get a lot better afterwards. While she's doing her homework at home, she wondered how her brother was doing out there. * Takaki's MW convoy were under heavy fire, in fact losing two brothers. The Tekkadan MS were about to sortie when Mossa's Geirail launched ahead. An SAU Hexa Frame Gilda got a bead on Takaki when the Geirail came to save the day. Billy Mays sure shot the hell out of that MS for good measure. Once again, Mossa played his ""give doggy a treat"" card on Takaki. * The Hotarubi have arrived at the Jutland 1 spaceport and the Martian boys finally got to see Terra. But the veterans knew they should've made Earthfall by then. Eugene was rightfully pissed with bureaucracy denying them a landing shuttle. In that case, he got just the plan to get to Earth... * Radish reported to Billy Mays that the Hotarubi has ""buggered off."" Ratdice was even impressed Mossa got the Tekkadan mutts on his leash. He's apparently taken a particular interest in Aston. * During their bout of insomnia, Takaki and Aston talked about how they're perceiving the war. And the former disapproves of the latter resigning to his imminent demise in battle. He's even sure Galan will get them all home soon. *sigh* Poor boy... * After a month of stalemate, McGillis decided to sortie in his Graze Ritter. An unexpected move for Billy Mays. Time to rouse the boys for the ""final battle!"" Even Takaki went to pilot a MS. If only he knew sooner that he had been dancing to Galan's fiddle tune. Cue ED. * The preview for next episode is brought to you by Guts mid-workout. From what we see, the Hotarubi indeed landed on Earth. I mean, of course. I just wonder if McCK will get his turn to turn the tables on Rustal in their game of intrigue where everyone is just a chess piece. Will we also see a 2nd Calamity War on the horizon?"

You can't just ignore how society works to make your point, no more than I can. The ""nice guy"" and TheRedPill mindsets that some men have adopted are the result of specific societal pressures and stereotypes. They are told that men are expected to go after women in romance. They are told women like confident and handsome men. They lack the confidence to talk to a woman, and maybe they are unattractive as well. Instead of looking at themselves and possibly changing, they latch on to stereotypes about women instead. Women only like men who are rich, or men that are assholes. The female gender is reduced to two things for them: anger about these false stereotypes, and pure sexual desire. That is where some of these sexual comments come from, and that is the danger in them. There is no exact equivalent to this for females. You can't just flip the issue and expect to make an argument, because men and women are very different and complex creatures. There are certainly women are who are bitter towards men, but more likely than not it isn't for the same reasons. There are no women furiously watching porn mumbling ""Stroke that cock, you manwhore, oh god men only want the rich and powerful girls."", or at least there aren't enough to warrant an argument."

1,15 second ads while waiting for combat to begin?,knnn,"If not a new mech pack, then what? The lack of new game play content should be a separate issue than PGI developing mech packs. You want to see more new content besides a new mech pack each month, fine, but how else do you propose PGI pay it's bills? Is PGI going to start selling maps or selling game modes? How would that work? PGI would have even more ""buckets"" because now you have some with the new DLC and others without it. PGI is selling mech packs because they want to get a majority of the BT universe in the game, but at the same time they have development costs. And mech packs aren't their only source of income. They developed two new systems this year, decals and supply caches. I do think that the game play is getting stale and different game modes are needed besides death balling, and PGI recognizes it. What aggravates me is the amount of discontent PGI receives about releasing new mech packs every month. It's what they're going to do because it's a legitimate profit model and the player base does want to see their favorite mechs come to the game eventually. Do you really want to see PGI stop releasing mech packs? Please stop bashing PGI for trying to pay their bills. It's a F2P play game already and I don't think they can eat their development costs on mechbays, premium time, patterns, colors, and decals alone. What fancy business model do you propose to PGI besides selling mech packs? If you don't have one, please stop with the ""no new mech packs"" nonsense, because PGI will consistently put out new mech packs each month because they have operations costs, which I'm quite surprised they can pay on what they are selling now in correlation to the size of the MWO community.

1,"In defense of alpha guys, it is hard to form long term relationships if you are in and out of prison all the time.",despisedlove2,"Discussion for all: patterns among alpha men... is it wrong to date girls with no long term intentions.. I see good debate on this subreddit and I enjoy reading it. &amp;nbsp; The pattern I see with successful/alpha guys I know is that they are serial monogamists. They have one relationship after another with hot women. What bothers me about this pattern (and thus prevents me from doing it myself) is that I know these guys have 0 long term intentions with these women. They don't say this explicitly to these girls, and in fact I think they somewhat imply the opposite. In fact, they may themselves believe the opposite, but most of the time it's 2 or 3 months and they're onto the next one. On the other hand, I know these girls know this, and I generally think women are more socially intelligent than men, so they must understand this pattern with the idea that they can lock down this guy if they are cool enough. &amp;nbsp; 1st question: is it okay to continue seeing a girl you have 0 intention of dating long term with 0 implication you don't want a long term relationship?? &amp;nbsp; One of the issues I have with these alpha guys I know is that they are generally stupid, and don't think long term. So it's genuinely possible they delude themselves into believing this girl ""could be the one"" in the moment, but decide on some ridiculous reason for dumping her for the next chick 2 months later. So should I be punished for knowing this girl doesn't fit into a long term vision of my life? Like, deep down I know I would never see this girl longer than a few months, but I want to continue seeing her for sex. I struggle with this in the sense that I am picky for a long term relationship, but want a short term, sexual relationship. I feel like if I communicate this explicitly, the woman will not be down, but if I don't say anything and imply that I want something more, I can play the serial monogamist game that the alpha guys I know do. &amp;nbsp; 2nd question: is it a learned pattern among alpha, serial monogamists to delude themselves into believing every hot girl they date could ""be the one,"" but then become extremely picky 2-3 months down the road in order to maximize sexual experiences/variety?? If so, is this immoral??"

It was ALWAYS our D on the field at the end of the game and losing us the game! Last year in Arizona Rodgers pulls another miracle out of his ass and forces OT and our D trots out to give up a 70+ yard catch and run by a 30+ year old WR, also no safety help and our DBs were stuck in 1vs1s. The year before that against Seattle we let Russell Wilson throw up a prayer and guess what? Again NO SAFETY HELP OVER THE TOP for our DB who gets beat to lose us the game. The years before that it was Crappernick (who is NOT a good QB) running rough shod on us all night long because Capers refuses to adjust his gameplan when things take a turn for the worse. Look I am not saying our offense doesnt share in the blame but the BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN THE GAME WAS ON THE LINE OUR D COULD NOT GET THE JOB DONE BECAUSE OF PISS POOR PLAYCALLING AND PUTTING PLAYERS IN UNWINNABLE SITUATIONS."

1,"You would have looked much smarter if you posted this a week ago, you smarty pants.",nye17,"Mark Ingram/Tim Hightower I've been thinking about this all day. If you want Mark Ingram, go get him on the cheap right now. Hightower is 30(when most RBs lose a step and become more susceptible to injuries). Against the worst run defense, his line was 23/87/1 (3.78 ypc). Ingram is 26. Against the worst run defense, his line was 15/158/1 (10.53 ypc, or 5.53 ypc if you take away that 75 yrd td). It should be noted that as Ingram ran in that 75 yrd TD, the mic picked him up saying ""Fuck wrong with these ni**as?"" I think its pretty likely Ingram is going to be playing his heart out the rest of this season. I hope Sean Payton was just trying to send a message to Ingram these past 2 games. But if Sean Payton thinks he can continue to let Hightower continue to out touch Ingram over these next 4 weeks, he's a fool. Their next 4 opponents are Denver, Carolina, LA, and Detroit(yes, their run defense pretty good). In at least 3 of those 4 games Ingram should be more productive than Hightower. If Hightower is out touching Ingram as much as he did yesterday over the next 4 weeks, there's a chance he gets injured. If you know you're going to the playoffs for sure, the Saints are playing Tampa Bay weeks 14 and 16. Go get Ingram right now and lock up an RB spot for those 2 weeks on the cheap. Its time for me to go clock out of work, so I have to stop typing now. But I think I got my point across."
1,No need for CDR pots when every item has it.,scuba156,"Health is completely different from Mana though. Health can be interacted with by both parties in a lane while Mana can only be used by the player. Mana potions are also not useable by all champions, there isn't a potion that increases energy regen, gives you fury, or reduces your cooldowns for a short while. While there are champions who health as a resource they are usually gated more by cooldowns then by their health costs (Morde after a ruby crystal for example). As noted below squishy champs are more likely to be bursted down then poked away. Potions can mitigate this somewhat if popped at an opportune time but no where to the degree that a mana potion will allow for some dominating a lane to keep up what is supposed to be a mana gated spell."

You'll always see many people running in my neighborhood, at all times of the day. We have nice wide sidewalks and most everyone is a courteous runner who moves aside when an overtaking runner calls 'on your left/right.' Very basic running courtesy, right? As I was coming up behind a pair of portly women ambling side by side, I call out, ""coming up behind you, on your left,"" and these two hams turn around, look at me, and continue on their conversation ignoring me. I couldn't hop out onto the street to overtake them (which is what I would normally do when it is possible so as not to bother walkers) as there was a lot of car traffic and bike traffic, plus at this point the landscaping was too thick to easily jump through. About 3 meters out, I call out again. Hams ignore me so I slow down so I can attempt to squeeze past them. As I do, the Ham closest to me hip-checks me. Now, a small hip-check amongst normal sized people will just displace you a foot or two. But a hip-check from a Ham vs a 105 lb female? I flew sideways, stumbling through the landscaping and into traffic, fell, and twisted my ankle. There was a car close enough to where I fell that had to hit the brakes to avoid hitting me. The hams? They LAUGHED. Didn't offer help, just kept walking and jaw jacking as if they didn't do a thing. A couple other runners saw what happened and while one went to run after the hams to confront them, the other helped me home."

1,Our government wouldn't that.,BlackGhostPanda,The CIA armed the Mujahideen. Which in turn gave rise to the Taliban/Bin Laden and threw Afghanistan back into the cultural stone ages. The CIA is arming the Peshmurga and YPG against ISIS despite the fact they are notoriously corrupt communists that want to conquer Turkey and establish a marxist state in the mid east. The CIA also armed most of the Syrian rebels (on both sides of the civil war there) which are now falling into ISIS ideologies.

If you talk to people in the Basque Country and Catalonia, a sizable number of them will dislike her, the king, and the entire idea of the monarchy. They see that whole establishment as a system that does not represent them at all, so why should they have to bow down to it? Now, if you talk to people from Madrid or the south, I'd assume you'd observe a completely different scenario, where people love and adore her/ the monarchy in general. My two cents? It's the 21st century, monarchies (and especially ones that are completely useless and have no power) should not exist anymore. From the fact that the Spanish monarchy was put back in power by a fascist dictator and allowed to remain, to the corruption scandals ala Princess Cristina, to the fact that the king's daughters each make a salary of over 100,000 euros a year for just existing while the economy and infrastructure of the country desperately needs investment... it's laughable really."

Since then our characters have only gotten stronger and going back and fighting Hogger on the same ground would feel a little off.

He has a difficult job, problems at home, he's a rotting corpse... but he gets by. It's all worth it because he can get home and relax with an episode of ""The Immortal and the Restless"", his all-time favourite show. He lets out a sigh, and his weary body collapses into his chair. It's been a long day, but it's worth it; he's had to wait a long time, but season 2 is finally here. He finally gets to see what happens with the baby! He can't contain himself, he's so hyped up for this, he can't stand it! He turns the TV on, changes the channel and, as the clock strikes 7:00... his favourite show is nowhere to be seen. He reels back, shocked. Surely, this is a mistake? A scheduling error? He's so concerned that he calls the network directly. He has to get to the bottom of this. After being kept on hold for about 20 minutes, he gets an answer. He begs them, pleads with them to tell him that there's been some kind of mistake. That his show will be back tomorrow night, or next week, right? ""I'm sorry sir, but 'The Immortal and the Restless' is no longer airing on this channel."" He goes from worried to furious. This was the ONLY channel it aired on! If they stopped airing it, it was as good as cancelled! He pushed them to see reason, but they wouldn't budge. He knew it was no good, but he needed SOME form of closure. He had to ask... WHY did they stop airing it? ""Well, sir, it's an extremely popular timeslot. Just when the adults are settling down, just before the kids have to go to bed. That's when most of the viewers come in, and another show was willing to pay more for the slot."" He dreaded the answer, he didn't know if he even cared all that much, but he needed to know. He couldn't let this go. If they were going to cancel HIS show, get rid of the one thing he looked forward to in the evenings... he was damn sure he'd know who was doing it. ""It's a pretty new show, sir, aimed at a family audience. It's really taking off, especially with the kids, but-"" He had to interrupt. He didn't CARE about how popular the show was (People these days just didn't have good tastes, that was all), he just wanted the name. Well, he didn't even really want to hear it at this point, but having come this far, he was going to get to the end of this. ""Fredbear &amp; Friends""."

They did bullshit figures of ""Most people don't want the faster speeds/usage limits, so they're not needed"" NO! That's not correct at all. It's because it costs too much. If we could have it at a reasonable price, we would, but a lot of us can't justify the high prices being charged for the decent NBN packages. I'm on the TPG unlimited ADSL2+ deal at present $60 for unlimited usage and a phone. NBN prices: * $60 for ""up to 12Mbps""... So, less than half of what this study considers broadband, and that's what I could get for the same price I'm paying now. (This would also be just marginally better than the around 8Mbps I get over ADSL2+) * $70 for ""up to 25Mbps""... Another $10 a month gives me ""up to"" what is considered broadband. * $100 for ""up to 100Mbps"" These are all just cases of them ticking a box, not changing hardware, doing any different wiring, just artificially limited the throughput in order to charge more. It's utter bullshit. NBN should be ALL 100Mbps or better (and the original plan was for up to 1Gbps), but noooo... we're stuck paying the same price for the same speed or worse. It's utter crap. It was supposed to be an investment in the future of the country, and it's been utterly smashed into a total waste of money that benefits no-one except the companies being paid to roll out an already dated technology, and the companies that had their crappy existing networks bought off them (which were then decided to be so crap as to be useless)."

1,10/10 would buff again,TrailminerCR,"buff for sparky Sparky is a 6 elixir legendary yet it is the only legendary which has not been seen in any meta. Sparky's main problem is that when it is zapped, it requires another 5 seconds to charge up. Proposed solution : Make zap (or any stun) unable to reset Sparky's charge time. Let's look at other heavy hitters. If we zap a balloon before it reaches the tower, it does not require an additional 3 seconds to drop its bomb. If we zap a mini pekka or pekka after it lifts up its sword, it does not require another 1.8 seconds to target, instead it continues the assault. If we zap a giant before it punches the tower, or a hog before it hammers the tower, both troops do not need an additional 1.5 seconds before charging up. This change will not make sparky overpowered, as small troops such as skeletons and goblins will still be able to distract sparky Alternatively, zap could reset every troops charge time for standardisation.

The removal of charge is a step in the right direction, it means that you actually have a chance of killing them 1v1 by keeping some distance rather than them just pressing their teleport button and shoving a shotgun up your ass. There's a few more things they could do. Either give them more HP and less damage or more damage and less health. Give them actual squad support abilities rather than just being a way for a shit player to force their way through a bunch of enemies. There needs to be a downside to pulling them too. Anyone who's got more than 1 brain cell can sustain themselves long enough to chain pull maxes infinitely. Making them unrevivable would be a good start. The weapons need to be balanced as well. VS get the best long range AI with blueshifts, TR get the best short range AV that is still good enough to actually be used in AI with pounders, and NC get slug shotguns which can instagib anyone out to 50-60m, which shouldn't happen with a shotgun. The long range AV needs to either be removed or fixed too. Ravens are broken within their effective range, TR get the shaft outside of 150m and VS get fuck all as well, but at least comets have no drop and can be used for a while. Basically they need a purpose other than 'oh we're getting our shit pushed in here, let us pull 6 maxes and retake' or 'I just died to the same guy 5 times in a row, let me pull a max so I feel better about my small penis'."

1,Can't bring guns into Starbucks locations.,machobeef,"Your first priority is the safety of yourself and the people you are responsible for. Do not at any time distract yourself from being aware of your surroundings and keeping your people safe until you are *sure* the danger has passed. If you need to relocate to guarantee safety, relocate to the nearest possible safe location. Usually you will be able to do this without traveling more than 20 - 50 yards (walk into a Starbucks). **At the first possible moment that you are safe**, call law enforcement, report what happened, report your location, and ask for emergency medical for any injured parties (including the person you were defending yourself from). If you can have someone else call 911 for you, so much the better. Point out a specific person and say, '*You* call 911'. This breaks them out of bystander effect. Give a detailed physical description of yourself, so that they will know who to look for when they arrive. If you can possibly help it, do not have a firearm in your hands when they show up (you *did* go to a safe location, right?). Remember, the cops are responding to an armed person call and will be accordingly keyed up, so no quick movements and no surprises. Be slow and deliberate and keep your hands visible. --- I am not a lawyer or expert of any kind, and this does not constitute expert advice."

I don't want to ghost her because I respect the relationship we had but I need to make it clear that I can't have a friendship with her through the same mediums that we couldn't have a relationship.

Assuming that the perpetrators would be islamist, what would be the foreign policy, immigration and general domestic security policy implications be? The May government has been criticised as being increasingly authoritarian. Do you think this trend would continue to rise more quickly? There's also a discussion about what impact it would have on the larger political scene in the uk - certainly the situation in Europe contributed to Donald Trumps narrative during the us election. How might it impact the overall political narrative in the uk?"

An hour goes by, then two when I finally start dozing off. I begin dreaming of my clothes sitting on the shelf of my closet. Pants, shirt, sweater, this is what I'll wear, if... Like, it had to be my blue jeans no rips, maybe I'll wear this pink shirt instead of that one with the hole at the bottom, instead of sweater maybe I'll put on a sweatshirt. About two hours after falling asleep I hear a loud crash in front of my apartment and bolt the fuck up out of bed shaking my boyfriend awake to tell him what I heard. We're both like, 'what's going on?' I say ""get dressed"" while I grab the clothes I just dreamt about, and pulling them on in a hurry we both run down the stairs and out the door to find the bed of his pickup truck sitting on top of the fire hydrant in the street in front of the apartment... WTF is going on? Then we see a compact car down the street, about three houses down, trying to make a get away. Boyfriend is freaking out while I run after the car, by this time it has come to a complete stop on its own accord, not the drivers. Theirs a twenty something year old girl behind the wheel whose freaking drunk af, I asked her if she was alright and she was, mind you this was early 80's and DWIs wasn't as big a deal as it is now adays. So she starts apologizing incoherently and starts crying, anyway at this point I'm more concerned about my boyfriends truck and the major damage she caused to the fire hydrant, it was surreal.

Well some guy came along with a company making plastic water charge containers. Basically the exact same thing as a Gatorade bottle, but in grey plastic. $20 a pop. A whole variety of them exist, and all are overpriced. Every unit I went to had a whole kit of them, which cost several hundred dollars. Nobody ever actually wanted to use the kit because it was an expensive and inventoried item that needed to be replaced if used. If you used any of it, you got grilled for not l just using a Gatorade bottle. We had a lot of tools like that, where either they did something nobody asked to have tool for, or they were a more expensive solution to a problem we'd already cheaply solved."

Who knows what kind of adventures Geralt has been on the past century being on the path? Here's an idea, in light of the holiday, try doing a christmas themed short story? Doesn't have to be named christmas, but you can come up with a holiday with a different name but the ideas of the holiday is all the same. And have the role of santa clause to be portrayed by a special kind of monster, while ugly and frightening to most folk. He just wants to make kids happy.

Living in the wasteland I imagine I'd feel a hell of a lot safer with some sort of fortification between me and the irradiated monsters out there. In terms of game mechanics, not all settlements have great spawn points for attackers, some being inside the build area, some being tied to fast travel points (including the mat you can place to change it) etc. There are ways around this. One is a mod to move problematic spawnpoints, such as Settlement Attacks Beyond. Another is to simply be aware of where enemies spawn and place your defenses accordingly. As an example, I've been building a lot at the Visitor's Center in Far Harbor lately and been attacked three times. I know where the enemies come from, so I've placed three minigun turrets (Another mod, Advanced Turrets or something similar) looking that way, as well as a guard post. It could be way better protected, but I don't want to go overboard and ruin the look of the place, so it'll have to do. What matters most to me with settlements is making them look cool, like they fit in the world and ideally have some sort of story tied to them. My character is heavily invested in the Minutemen and so most of my settlements are either Minutemen outposts or independant towns with a Minutemen presence.

1,*Waifus *Overpowered Myunits *Bad stories Who even likes strategy?,ColinWins,"What are the elements or experiences that you expect and enjoy from a Fire Emblem game? I generally started this text talking about my disappointment with FE:6 and it grew to a list of things that I didn't really like about it, but now I've let it morphed into another topic entirely, which is this: What are the elements or experiences that you expect from a Fire Emblem game? There are so many different elements of the Fire Emblem game that make the whole challenging, fun, engrossing, and interesting. We tend to oscillate between the technical and mechanical aspects of the game: tinkering and obsessing over your units' growth and development, completing all there is to the map, managing your inventory and weapons, etc; and learning about the story and your units individual subplots, perspectives, and relations with other units. These dual elements both engross the player's interest in different ways to create a tactical and emotional bond with the units you have of the course of the journey. For me, in a sequential order as best I can, I enjoy: -Being introduced to a continent with royal families and warring countries/ city-states. -Starting the game out with a main character with a group of friends. -Spending a couple chapters fighting brigands, bandits, or pirates so you get hooked on leveling up this ragtag group of friends and growing attached to them. -Spending some chapters leveling a new low-level unit. -After a couple easy chapters, the story tends to build up in stakes and consequences, with a new important character and story element that brings in a sense of war and an impending doom. -Around this time you start to do more dungeons and castles where you start to get obsessed with getting all the chests or recruiting that hard to get unit. -You acquire a lot of different unit archetypes and you weigh your options of who you wanna play with. And get obsessed with leveling, growth, and promotion. -You feel like a badass with your cool newly promoted units for a little while -The chapters start to get really difficult for the last couple chapters -You pull of a tough win that you feel more adept to handle each time you play through. -You play through again and refine your gameplay, making wiser decisions, making efficient choices, trying to build your squad you want to play with, being better at building character supports, avoiding wasting exp, and correcting flustered decisions you made when experiencing the map for the first time. -You start to experiment with weirder builds, leveling up that character you never use, or Overall, the thing I love the most is how you become attached to your units' stories and development on a chapter to chapter basis, in which you tactically scrutinize your choices to get the most out of the map for your units, then get the emotional satisfaction of the story, which then furthers your desire to see your units become well-trained and stronger. Almost as if the tactical work you put into your characters helps realize and further their story, because we get to see them develop through support conversations, see them physically change through promotion, and see them become stronger on the battlefield. Are there any other aspects of the game that you personally love? I'm kind of a newer fan, I played Path of Radiance when I was in middle school, and decided to get back into it almost a decade later by playing FE:7 and am currently working my way through FE:6 and despite my apparent newness, I find myself fairly attached, obsessed, and immersed in the series, so I just want general idea of what people love about it so that maybe I can understand why I love the series so much."

1,"Oh, like a 7/7 for 4 that locks 2 mana on your next turn?",Pod607,"Hearthstone needs more cards with big drawbacks. One of my favourite cards this expansion and a card that was unexpectedly good is dirty rat. It allows for insane combo's with brann, mc tech, board clears, etc. Ofcourse the dirty rat also has a lot of drawbacks like pulling out your opponents ragnaros or four mana 7/7 if you aren't able to clear it. It's a card that isn't overpowered but can be insane in the right situation. Same goes with cards like Doomsayer, they have a clear drawback. (can be cleared without taking damage, can clear your own board if revived/pulled out.) But it can also give you the board or set the enemy back a turn on an empty board. They're in my opinion the most fun cards to play. They can be strong in the right situation or can just massively screw you over. They aren't always good like a certain pirate that is in charge now. But when they are it's so satisfying."

The open betas allow feedback to help the devs not only tweak and balance everything that's already in place but it also helps find any bugs that might have been overlooked during small QA sessions to allow devs to polish it up before the game's release date. So yes, it is a beta. I hate this mentality that betas are glorified demos. I'd argue that's true if the beta was released a week before the game came out but that's not the case here. Shut up."

1,Give Elulim's Frenzy Taken Thrall burn and we'll consider this a success,IJustJason,"Kings Fall raid weapons, replace Will of Light with counter-Taken perks. So this is obviously a little late, and I'm unsure if this has been brought up before so my apologies if it has. However what would you think if instead of having the innate perk: Will of Light, This weapon deals bonus damage against Taken enemies. They instead each had an innate and unique perk that countered a particular Taken enemy's ability. So each different weapon would have a place for mitigating an individual ability. You would have to have the weapon drawn for the perk to work, as a way to balance it out though. Examples: Elulim's Frenzy (rocket launcher). Perk: Completely ignores Vandal bubble and can pass right through. Silence of A'arn (shotgun). Perk: Phalanx Shield Blast does not move the player (still does damage though). Anguish of Drystan (auto rifle). Perk: Psions that take damage from this gun can't multiply (maybe throw in for 5 seconds or something). Midha's Reckoning (fusion rifle). Perk: Hobgoblin's defensive orbs explode when the Hobgoblin is hit with rounds fired from this gun. Zaouli's Bane (handcannon). Perk: Captain's orbs of bullshitery can be destroyed with a shot(1 shot) from this gun. This isn't a comprehensive list or anything (obviously) and I'm only spit balling here, but this would encourage usage of raid weapons and might (*might*) make them fun or interesting to use. Plus fuck those Taken bastards. TL;DR: Raid weapons could have been interesting, fuck the Taken."

It doesn't seem to correlate with anything (environment, season, etc.) except I think it's only happened when I'm sitting down, but that's probably coincidence because I sit a lot.

A gaffe like this is usually enough to sink a candidate's chances. Yet Trump can repeatedly demonstrate he doesn't know what he's talking about, and TV journalists don't jump on those gaffes. They should be latching on to every mistake Trump makes like a lion going after a baby elephant.

1,"the story is really well-written, but the thing with the human chain and the blood on the wall just doesn't fit with the end...",Chaphasilor,"We'd missed our flight more than twenty four hours ago, and I'd been on the phone with Linda's parents trying to explain to them what had happened to their daughter. Most of the conversation had consisted of: ""Just turn on a TV! It's on every channel!"" The whole airport had been shut down, the goddamn ladies' room had been cordoned off, and at this point estimates were that there were no less than fifty-three people in there, Linda included. At one point they'd taken the door off the hinges and sent people in as a human chain. Just watching it, just looking in from a distance had been nauseating, the white tile warping subtly and curving and seeming to go on forever. Someone's grip had slipped, and another nine people lost to the ladies' room. The survivors had told horror stories about blood and other bodily fluids, toilets clogged and overflowing. They'd eventually had to put the door back up. The plan now was to just blow open a wall on the side of the ladies' room, make it so that it wasn't a room anymore. Current scuttlebutt was about what would happen to the people who were still inside. There was a lot of talk about shaped charges, controlled demolition, words that made my head spin. I was on my knees, praying, when there was a sudden rush of air out of the room, like everyone taking a breath. The door swung open and Linda stepped out, primping her hair, as fine as the moment she'd walked in. Twenty four hours living in an airport had turned me into a goddamn mess. The crowd burst into cheers, rushing around her, two officers ushering her away from the door as she looked around in shock. I was pushing up-current through the crowd, screaming, ""It's me! Linda, it's me! That's my wife! Oh my god, that's my wife!"" There were hands on the both of us pushing us forwards, and then she was in my arms again and everyone else mercifully backed away. ""Linda!"" I said, and collapsed on my knees, dragging my head down to her waist. ""Oh my god, Linda, I thought I lost you, you were in there for hours, hours, over a day!""

I reproduced the EXACT same feelings in exactly the same way that I had teaching the gospel for 20 years, only I was testifying about FUCKING ICE CREAM. Even sitting here typing this now, I can get those ""spirit"" juices flowing by just saying ""I Know"" in a low voice. Check and mate. If I can invoke ""this spirit"" to testify of literally _anything_ then it's just emotion. How in the HELL did I not see this as a TBM?"

If people were able to upgrade their stats to 10 instead of 7 there would be alot more variety in classes as people wouldn't just immediately go to max a stat like damage or health or whatever stat you would normally max. And you may be thinking that this would make so many classes op (I don't know how) and that it wouldn't be very fair or something. But even though someone could make a 10 bullet speed overlord or something that would probably be overpowered it balances out as they would have to sacrifice other stats to max it.

She protested saying that she can't compel her husband to pay tithing on his income and that she doesn't work and doesn't have income. Bishop pulls her temple recommend and says she can't hold a calling. Is this a standard practice? I've never heard of this before."

Also the song on its own is actually pretty dope to me. Nothing felt like it didn't give as much as it wanted, the fact it was unexpected when the actual drop was going to come made the song much more interesting to listen to than most EDH songs. Finally I have no idea why people see Zedd and expected some insane epic shit. He's not even that kind of producer. This actually feels like Zedd's take on the ideas Riot gave to him and not just ""make really loud memorable chorusy song and slap your name on it so people will be hyped"". It felt personal which is way better imo. Sorry I liked it guys, and I'm sure other people want to discuss it too without having to sift through the thousand ""it generic succ"" comments on the main thread."

I got kicked, was not allowed to rejoin, got no credit for the win, and was slapped with a 10 minute timer that made my team wait before looking for another match. So dumb."

It's not how Jensen constantly checks out his left hand. Dude's gotta make sure his equipment is 100% working order, even if it does seem a little obsessive. It's that Adam is just casually and leisurely walking through the tunnels. There's no rush, right? It's not like Marchenko is initiating another attack or anything. You'd think Adam would haul ass and sprint or at least jog through the tunnels, and he wouldn't tire himself anytime soon thanks to his augments, but no. He apparently feels like taking in the sights of the Prague underground. I imagine the final mission would have turned out very different had Jensen decided not to take four hours to traverse the damn subway tunnels. TF29 would've gotten to London on time, stopped Marchenko and his goons before they even had a chance to enact their plans, and might've even joined the guests at the party for drinks afterwards. Thanks a lot, Jensen. Hope taking your time was worth it."

1,But Black Lives Matters says only white people can be racist!,Fenixx117,"Racism is a primitive emotional response, it has nothing to do with facts or reason. We humans are a tribal primates. Our brains are very similar to what they were 50,000 years ago; biological evolution takes a long time. One consequence of this is tribalism, an instinct whereby an ""us"" group and a ""them"" group are created (with ""them"" being demonized). This is an animalistic instinct, it is very powerful and very dangerous. Many people go above our animalistic instincts because we can understand it with reason. Many other people however, for multiple reasons, do not. Racism is fundamentally an extension of this tribalism; it's categorizing other people as outside the in-group and demonizing and scapegoating them collectively, with little regard to the constituent individuals. An easy answer to complex questions."

I have a BFA and I'm still on my college's newsletter for news on jobs, lectures, residencies and such. Also, they'll sometimes mention when work spaces have opened up for artists to rent; living in a busy city with high rents, underpaid artists often have a hard time finding a studio they can afford. And sometimes people take advantage of that. So too the most recent e-mail which boldly asked me ""Are you looking for a studio and do you like working with kids?!"" Oh boy. The premise is that a school in a low-income neighborhood has an extra building they're not using, and they want to rent the space out to artists for their studios and to have the artists be *accessible* to the teachers, children and parents to as to try and inspire them. Note, I said rent. Not only would your studio be on the schoolyard, where large groups of loud children would take turns screaming their heads of, they can enter the building, maybe even your studio, and also hang around after school hours. And you're expected to PAY for the privilege and it wasn't cheap either! It's actually more expensive than my anti-squat space nearby which I only share with a few photographers! Needless to say I laughed and deleted the e-mail, counting my blessings that I needn't depend on greedy breeders just to have a space to work. In so much an artist could get any damned work done under those conditions."

He began to notice that weed was missing(the guy was taking small bits at a time) and once he saw a sizable amount gone, he basically waited for the guy to go into his room again while he was out, and caught him trying to roll it up. His response was ""I was gonna pay you back). No weed was missing for a while, but 30 minutes ago, i was doing my laundry and he asked if i stole weed. I looked at him crazy cause he know i wouldn't take any, then he said he *knew* it was the guy next door. He went and asked the problem guy but of course he said no. If weed was actually missing, then it was for sure the guy next door. * I smoke weed but i've never been pressed to the point where i'd sneak in and steal some. I also have other friends who smoke and he knows this/ * Another house mate is rarely home and doesn't smoke ever. * There is another guy who smokes but he can't smoke a lot and always asks ahead of time. * Problem guy smokes, had his friend steal weed, and seems to the type of guy who feels he can do whatever.

1,"Yes, shame on you fans for causing this whole incident.",14thAndVine,"Is it ok to be a Penn State fan again? Figured I'd get the opinion here. Back story: I grew up outside State College. I was raised on Nittany Lion football. I'm 34 so all I knew was the good times. Paterno and linebacker U. I was die hard. Then 2011 happened. Sandusky, Paterno getting fired/passing away, sanctions, punishment, scandal. To me Sandusky committed the worst of crimes. I can't stomach the idea of what he did. So, I stopped watching, stop following, afraid to be aligned with it all. I've spent this time since not following any one team. So, is it safe yet? Can I put my Nittany blue back on? Has it all died down enough? Opinions?"

1,"Trickle down economics, it'll work out in the end",myheadsmt,"Gym Stagnation and The Economics of Pokemon Go Over the past week, many gyms have gone up to Level 10 and seem pretty settled. We've all talked about how that can make the game less fun, but think about what Niantic just did to the economics of their app. Pokemon Go is a freemium game. Most play for free but some pay real money for coins. **Coins are the way Niantic monetizes its product.** They're a limited resource that you have to work for, or you can pay for them to get around the grind. Since the training change, top level players can easily park their Dragonites, Arcanines, etc. in gyms and others will avoid taking down a bunch of Level 10 gyms because its too much work for 10 coins and a bit of XP. **In this system, most gyms get locked with little turnover.** There are two ways to think of this: 1. Players at Level 25+ with high CP defenders are pretty much set. They can lock in and collect 50-100 coins every day, almost indefinitely. In economic terms, those players can print money for themselves. 2. For everyone else, coin scarcity just shot up. There are fewer gyms that you can quickly flip and get an extra 10 coins for the day. The cost of freeing up a gym has significantly increased. **They've basically built an economy that rewards the top 1% of players and makes it harder for everyone else to get ahead.** A big question for Niantic's economics is what that does to the total number of coins distributed each day. If a gym is locked at Level 10 and no one attacks it, that gym only gives out 100 coins/day. If it's fluidly changing hands, it may produce coins for 25 different players in a day (250 coins/day). They've bet their only source of revenue (in-app coin purchases) on making resources free to top players and adding friction for casual players that want to get ahead. It's counter-intuitive for many freemium models since your most engaged users are usually most likely to pay you. Maybe their monetization data shows something we don't know, or maybe they just turned their whole economy upside down."

Why is it that so often it seems the camera quality is from 2008, and the frames seem to always skip important subframes? I recognize cost can be a mitigating factor, but you'd think there'd be 1 or 2 with super high quality, slow motion ability. Is there a reason there aren't these cameras outside of cost?

I love the balancing patches. It is so exciting, opening it up like a shiny present and looking to see if a skill got changed, or completely reworked. It can also be a dissapointment time and again seeing a monster that in your eyes appears to need buffs not getting the help it deserves. Below write 3, and only 3 monsters you feel should be buffed and how you think they should be buffed. I will start Beth - Increase Damage on her AOE, Make 100% defense break on 3rd skill(without skill ups) and instead of Accuracy increase Speed. Rakan - Make his first and 3rd skill scale with Hp so he can be the fire tank that murders all the lushens. Zibrolta - I know this is a weird one, but make it so his 2nd skill actually hits for damage. Increase the damage of the second skill and make the 3rd skill a full AOE instead of a random skill."
